		<description><![CDATA[i handed in war child, my track that i did in recording in moseley studios.
it was played on brett birks new music, and in jukebox at mac.
all i want is people to listen to it, dont care if it doesnt do well, or not sold.
there my vocals, on track, 102 views on youtube.
what do you do, with the audios cds, do you play them.
thanks. it was based on a channel 4, war child.
