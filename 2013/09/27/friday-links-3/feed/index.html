		<description><![CDATA[Hi, the Birmingham Secular Fellowship is having its first meeting this Sunday Oct 6th at 11:00 at the Birmingham Buddhist Centre, 11 Park Road, Moseley B13 8AB.

You can join us right at the beginning of our enterprise, it&#039;s free to attend. How exciting!

Our theme is technology and human behaviour. Between the singing and the biscuits we will hear from Dr. Ben Cowan from the University of Birmingham on persuading people to be more green. Ben’s work focuses on the psychological influence of technology and how it affects the user’s behaviour. He is particularly interested how design affects human-computer dialogue and how technologies can be used to persuade people to change environmentally negative behaviours.

Our own Tom Askew will talk to us about having a social life in the age of the Internet, something he knows a great deal about! We will also have a time of quiet reflection and opportunities to share something joyful from our lives.]]></description>
