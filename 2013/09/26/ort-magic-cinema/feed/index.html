		<description><![CDATA[We are People&#039;s Park Friends @Cannonhillpark and have a short film to show called &#039;Breathing Spaces&#039; from the 1960s with Balsall Heath kids playing in the streets and the bomb pecks down Edward Road. But the plan for Birmingham Living Spaces in the 70s replaced this with new housing and open green space with trees, and school groups using parks to learn about nature. Come and discuss what change brought then, playing out now and why we value green space as living spaces today.
Would you like to see short local films shown in the Park?
We look forward to the return of the local Magic Cinema alongside Ort Cafe.]]></description>
