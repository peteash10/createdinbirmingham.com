		<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,

Firstly, we would like to thank you for putting our anniversary poster in your window when we were running our pop up art gallery event.  

Our next fund raising event is a Christmas arty/fabric craft fair (November) which we thought you may be interested in.  Give us a shout if you fancy a stall.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Coustis]]></description>
