		<description><![CDATA[This tells me the following: when you visit Birmingham you actually don&#039;t really want to visit Birmingham. You should instead visit the Black Country for the individually profiled Gazebo theatre that deserve a special mention outside of the theatre section, the Red House Glass Cone (instead of a highlight feature on the Jewellery Quarter?) and The Public, which gets a mention in several categories. It doesn&#039;t actually seem to be successful in promoting local cultural organisations, venues and companies that are Birmingham based. A few such companies are lucky to get a name check over paragraphs dedicated to non Birmingham centric venues and activities. Wider cross promotion for the region makes perfect sense, especially with the diverse range of exciting venues and organisations worth noting, but when it is for Visit Birmingham the focus should be proportionate.  

I&#039;m sure this was an expensive photograph to commission and yet isn&#039;t being fully utilised or showcased due to the basic and poor dynamics of the website not enabling an interactive image or a full screen view of it. In essence must try harder and revisit the whole brand package and mechanisms for promoting Birmingham (especially the dull uninspiring website).]]></description>
