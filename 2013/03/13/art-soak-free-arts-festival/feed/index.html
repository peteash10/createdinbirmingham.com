		<description><![CDATA[Hi Carol, 

We listed it on CiB ten days ago, and it has been on local blogs in the area for several weeks now. The organisers distributed leaflets/posters in high street shops across the entire Selly Oak district. They have also been featured in the Birmingham Post and the Birmingham Mail. 

Where would you have expected/liked to have seen it advertised? It’s always good to hear feedback from local community members, and perhaps anyone else reading this comment can take on your feedback too.

Best regards,
Kerry]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this festival sounds great, but was totally unaware of it until a small piece came onto the local bbc news. I actually live in the area. Its such a shame that there has not been more advertising as of course this helps with attendence of the events.
I hope that it all goes well, but maybe a local mail shot would have been great listing the venues and events, times etc..
