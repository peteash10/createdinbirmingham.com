<p><a href="https://macbirmingham.co.uk/event/on-the-road-to-belonging">On the Road to Belonging</a>, created by Work in Progress (WiP) and funded by Arts Council England, is a multi-art form event supporting young people and children in exploring themes of belonging taking place on Wednesday 1 June, 12noon – 8pm at mac birmingham.</p>
<p>As part of the event WiP will present a brand new piece of theatre, Belonging. Aimed at audiences aged 14years+ Belonging introduces two groups of characters desperately trying to find a place to belong as their lives hang in the balance.</p>
<p>We hear the stories of five people brought together by circumstance. Sleeping in a cardboard city of secrets, fears and anxieties which fuel the unquenchable fire they encamp around at night. As reality hits they discover that the fire is not the only thing awake at night. In the meantime a band of space travellers desperately search for a place to land. They are passed from pillar to post between inflexible regimes, changing opening times, unwilling citizens and a government in chaos.</p>
<p>FREE to attend however book your place via <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/on-the- road-to-belonging-tickets- 22539132151">eventbrite</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/amyrozelmartin">Amy Martin</a> got in touch with us to tell us about Birmingham Soup:</strong></p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>What is SOUP?</strong></p>
<p>SOUP is a democratic experiment in micro-funding.</p>
<p>Each month we hold a <a href="https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/">Birmingham </a><a href="https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/">SOUP</a> event at <a href="https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/t/">Impact Hub Birmingham</a>, you bring a dish to share (if you want) and pay a suggested donation of £5 or more on the door.</p>
<p>Audiences hear pitches from four pre-selected proposals working on projects that benefit communities in Birmingham. Over a potluck/picnic-style SOUP dinner, attendees cast their vote for the project they want to help fund.</p>
<p>The project with the most votes goes home with all of the money raised from the door. Winners come back to a future SOUP to tell the audience how their project went, how they used the money and what impact the project had on the community.</p>
<p>SOUP is a powerful tool to start conversations, practise democracy and fund new projects/people/ideas in our city. There are many models on how to do it but we follow the <a href="http://detroitsoup.com/">Detroit SOUP</a> method which means that all the events are run by a team of volunteers.</p>
<p>I started Birmingham SOUP as an antidote to austerity. Birmingham has been hugely affected by the cuts to local services.  This is a small but powerful way for a community to directly support one and other and a super accessible way for people to access money for projects with social impact.</p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve raised £2200 for 7 creative projects in Birmingham, previous winners have included Elliot Lord who engineered and constructed special cardboard beds for the homeless that raises them from the floor to give them a better night’s sleep. Artist Mohammed Ali who was fundraising for a new arts centre in Sparkbrook. Second Pedals who re-commission second hand cycles, a creative project in response to the refugee crisis called Beyond Borders. The Danny Campaign who helps homeless people keep in touch with their loved ones and Tasty Waste a campaign and workshops about unnecessary food waste and healthy eating.</p>
<p>We are really excited about the potential of Birmingham SOUP and would like to expand our reach to more people, we are currently seeking pitch proposals for our event on June 9th: <a href="https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/t/">https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/</a></p>
<p><strong>Deadline for pitch proposals is 2nd June.</strong> The application process is really simple &#8211; just 5 questions on an online form here: <a href="https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/submit-a-proposal/">https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/submit-a-proposal/</a></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this email, please check out the website for more information: <a href="https://birminghamsoup.co.uk/">https://birminghamsoup.co.uk</a></p>

<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT IS THE ‘MINERVALA MARKET’?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The Minervala Market is a nomadic trading post where artists and makers can trade materials and tools that are cluttering up studio spaces. It is set up during a time when finances are low and spaces to create work may becoming rarer.</p>
<p class="p1">A follow on from ‘CARAVAN’, ’MINERVALA MARKET’ is an unashamedly self-centred yet imaginative look at how artists will survive as a community come the apocalypse by Jonny Graney and Dale Hipkiss.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>WHAT CAN YOU TRADE?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Is your studio space cluttered with materials you bought/ found but no longer have a use for because of a change in practice? Your relationship to that object may have changed but there are other artists whom may place great value upon it!</p>
<p class="p1">So bring it along and see what other people have- you may find something you really need too!</p>
<p class="p1">Bring along any unneeded studio paraphernalia or even inhabit a stall and run your own business. but remember the market place works as a non-monetary bartering system.</p>
<p class="p1">The show takes place on every Saturday Night in August at <a href="http://thewigbirmingham.blogspot.co.uk/">The Wig</a>: that’s 6th, 13th, 20th and 27th of August.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’d like to book a stall for that entire duration or just one night, then get in touch via:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="mailto:jonathancharlesgraney@hotmail.co.uk">jonathancharlesgraney@hotmail.co.uk</a> or <a href="mailto:dalehip@hotmail.co.uk">dalehip@hotmail.co.uk</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that <a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Flatpack Film Festival</a> is ten. Spawned from short film nights at the Rainbow in Digbeth, the festival now takes over the city with screenings, performances, installations and happenings every year.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s festival kicks off slightly later than usual (19-24 April) and is a little shorter than previous editions. However, it will feature the same cinematic fun and games that is known and loved for.</p>
<p>A couple of this year&#8217;s highlights:</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/vampyr/" target="_blank">Vampyr</a> &#8211; One of cinema’s landmarks, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s mesmerising horror Vampyr (1932), accompanied live by four-piece multi-instrumentalists Minima and film pianist Stephen Horne.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/oh-dear-diary/" target="_blank">Oh Dear Diary</a> &#8211; Brace yourself for an evening of angst-ridden, cringe-inducing, revealing and often unintentionally hysterical real life stories, as a group of volunteers read aloud from their teenage diaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/pierre-bastien/" target="_blank">Pierre Bastien</a> &#8211; Textured looping soundscapes made from Meccano parts, motors, fans, and rattles + trumpet.A treat for the eyes and ears.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/sound-and-vision/" target="_blank">Sound and Vision </a>&#8211; A mesmerising live AV triple-bill using lamps, lenses, modified record players, looping records and found objects. Those taking an analogue approach to their craft on the night include Amsterdam-based duo <a href="http://www.opticalmachines.nl" target="_blank">Optical Machines</a>, sound artist <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a> and Berlin-based artist collective <a href="ttp://transforma.de" target="_blank">Transforma</a> with musician/composer PC NAKT.</p>
<p>The full programme will be online in the next few weeks.</p>
