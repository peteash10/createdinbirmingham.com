<p>The <a href="http://pkbham.uk/">Pecha Kucha Birmingham</a> team have announced the next five dates. These include events in partnership with International Dance Festival Birmingham and Flatpack Film Festival.</p>
<p>Tuesday night sees the return of Pecha Kucha Birmingham, as part of <a href="http://rethinkmedia.biz/">Rethink Media festival</a>, which in turn is part of The Digital Cities Birmingham 2016 (events activities and collaborations across the city from 14-20th March.)</p>
<p>There are eight speakers booked to talk in the 20&#215;20 format on Tues, covering topics from operatic sopranos, disability, refugees, theatre and more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tightcontrol">Zoe Partington</a></strong> is a disabled artist who uses her practice to challenge stereotypical thinking in visual art. Her talk is on re-framing visual media so you don’t exclude the excluded. How do we transfer iconic images and visual information into descriptive words so they have meaning for all?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/golding">Frank Golding</a></strong> is a former Director at Google where he worked on product, sponsorship and creative strategies. He now leads Golding Media Ventures, LLC and Run or Pass, Inc. His talk will be on the 50 year career of operatic soprano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Pons">Lily Pons</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/rocio_carvajalc">Rocio Carvajal</a></strong>, a Pecha Kucha veteran from Mexico, is an author, educator, blogger, baker and researcher of gastronomic heritage. Her talk is titled “The language of food: Bread stamping in colonial Mexico” and will look at how the codes embedded in and on food tell a story of the moral, economic, ethical, religious and even political views of its time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MrASingh">Amrit Singh</a></strong> is the founder of NowHumanity and Rebel Creatives. He’s talk, “Refugees are Human too”, features powerful photographs from his recent trip to Lesvos, Greece helping refugees, visiting camps, volunteering and showing the power of live broadcasting on the ground.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nextpageprods">Caroline Nash</a></strong> is an actress and producer of local theatre in the Midlands and a recent Come Dine With Me winner. She will be talking about the challenge of producing a theatre with interactive elements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/iamsteadman/">Mark Steadman</a></strong> is a web developer, the organiser of Ignite Brum and, from June, a freelancer. He’s talking about the medium of podcasting, about making media without asking permission, how amazing stories can be told and minds changed, and how it’s not all about Serial.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.boldtextcollective.wordpress.com/">Tim Stimpson</a></strong> is representing <strong>Bold Text Playwrights</strong>, a collective of 8 playwrights from the West Midlands region. He also writes for The Archers. He’ll be talking about how they got together to connect with our regional audience and give them new and exciting theatre and how there’s still lots more to do.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/peteashton">Pete Ashton</a></strong> is an artist who works with cameras, and occasionally makes photographs with them. He’s a Birmingham Open Media fellow and is current developing “What If..? Cameras”, image-capturing devices which might exist in alternative realities where the DSLR and cameraphone don’t dominate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tickets for Pecha Kucha Birmingham at Rethink Media are £5 (<em>and include a complementary drink and snacks.) </em>More information / tickets via <a href="http://pkbham.uk/">their website</a>!</p>

<p><strong>This morning I enjoyed listening to Badego&#8217;s Small Talk podcast, with guest speaker Matthew Nation from Provide. </strong></p>
<p>Badego is a bi-weekly meet-up for those in the creative industry / design industry which takes place in Birmingham. Small Talk is a sub-brand of that, with events and now, podcasts.</p>
<p>Every week Small Talk invites a guest speaker to join in the conversation about their chosen topics. This week &#8211; their sixth edition &#8211; the subjects were subscription services, Ai Wei Wei&#8217;s lego/China fiasco and the Steve Jobs film.</p>
<p>I was really interested in hearing the chat / mixed views on subscription-based services. How much is too much? I personally pay for several subscription-based services both for my work and personal life to include Dropbox, Squarespace, Spotify, Sky, Adobe Creative Cloud and Headspace. The speakers on the podcast were discussing pay-per-click content, what you can get for your money (sometimes physical copies cost only a marginal amount more than digital copies of say, games, for example), record ownership and sharing and the passing down through generations of music, and how generationally everything is continually changing and what will happen in the future. Matthew Nation brought up that some people will happily pay for content, and some will balk at the price &#8211; whether it&#8217;s digital or analogue. A lot of people will pay up to £20 for magazines if they value their content &#8211; which they then get to keep, something you don&#8217;t get with stream services.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found myself wanting to ask loads of questions and take part*! One day I hope there&#8217;s a live show of Small Talk Podcast with a Q&amp;A at the end. I&#8217;d certainly go.</p>
<p>You can listen to the podcast on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/small-talk-creative-discussion/id1037955629?mt=2">iTunes</a> and follow @<a href="http://twitter.com/wearebadego">wearebadego</a> on twitter to find out about their meet-ups, events and other stuff.</p>
<p><em>*Luckily I work with Dan at AVFC, so that was possible! </em></p>

<p><strong>How can Birmingham shout louder about culture?</strong></p>
<p>A group of young people who are part of the Creative Agency project at mac birmingham are asking the creative community to come together for <em>The Welcome Party</em> to try and find out how we can do better. Organised by The Icing Agency and cultural website <a href="http://polaroidsandpolarbears.co.uk/" target="_blank">Polaroids &amp; Polar Bears</a>, the event looks to bring together like-minded creative people who are passionate about culture within Birmingham.</p>
<p>As anyone who has been to Birmingham knows it is a place full of arts and culture. But unlike cities such as Manchester and Liverpool it has not yet found a way to truly shout out about itself. <em>The Welcome Party</em> gives the people of Birmingham a chance to discuss and debate how we can improve our national image.</p>
<p>The event is open to all who are passionate about Birmingham’s culture, whether it be creative communicators, arts marketers, web developers, filmmakers, bloggers, artists, musicians, photographers, or journalists.</p>
<p>The event is on Monday 9th March and you can book your free place here: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-welcome-party-tickets-15786982289" target="_blank">https://www.eventbrite.<wbr />co.uk/e/the-welcome-party-<wbr />tickets-15786982289</a></p>
