		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for this post. We are making some progress in fund raising and talking to a number of social enterprise finance bodies and the Council about long term plans but really want to encourage small donations and investments to help in the mix. We have raised almost £1600 in investments and donations so far. Thanks again.
