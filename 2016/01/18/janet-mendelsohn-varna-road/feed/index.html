		<description><![CDATA[I saw the exhibition today it was shocking but fascinating. My father also took some photographs around that time in the sixties. He was at Bournville College of Art. His name was Mike Banner. If anybody remembers him or might know if he was a friend of Janet&#039;s please let me know.

Maybe he was influenced by her work or it was just a coincidence. It is hard to imagine that level of poverty and a reminder of where as a country we don&#039;t want to be.

Thanks.]]></description>
