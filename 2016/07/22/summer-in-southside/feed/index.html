		<description><![CDATA[Hi Karla

I don&#039;t think that would be the Created in Birmingham team (we are just a blog who wrote about the event, not the organisers of this event). 

You would be best contacting Summer in Southside directly - http://www.enjoysouthside.co.uk/contact/

Great to hear you had a good time.

best wishes

We had a fantastic time at summer in south side Sunday .
My daughter and husband were interviewed by your team at the end of the day covered in blue streamers!

Many thanks
