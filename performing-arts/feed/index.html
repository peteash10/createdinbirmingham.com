<p><a href="http://hfwas.co.uk/?p=3173"><em>Homegrown</em></a> is an ambitious artist development programme run by Birmingham live art agency Home For Waifs and Strays,  supported by Arts Council England and the Jerwood Charitable Trust. The aim of the programme is to showcase some of the great live art and performance talent in the West Midlands by giving emerging artists the chance to receive mentoring, develop new work and perform at venues across the UK.</p>
<p>After touring to some of the country’s premiere live art venues, <em>Homegrown </em>comes to <a href="http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/">Vivid Projects</a> for the final performance of the programme. On Friday, there will be a showcase of the work developed by the chosen artists over the last four months. The artists are an eclectic group, with practices comprising drag performance, performative baking, filmmaking, writing and theatre. One of the artists, Albert Smith, uses baking and bread making metaphors to explore his ideas and tell his stories. Another, Andy Howlett, is an artist and filmmaker who is exploring the possibilities of film as a live medium. Andy draws inspiration from the streets of Birmingham and is interested in the work of the Birmingham surrealists. China Dethcrash is a ‘swamp witch, performer and storyteller’, who invites audience members into her specially constructed dwelling for one-on-one performance.</p>
<p>Homegrown takes place from 7-10pm on Friday 9 September at Vivid Projects, Digbeth. Entry is free.</p>

<div class="gmail_default">This follows on from our work for the Elliott Review set up by the Government in the wake of the horsemeat scandal . . .  to raise public awareness of the issues and the widespread implications of food crime both locally and nationally — and to create a platform for discussion.</div>
<div class="gmail_default"></div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p>It&#8217;s all huge fun &amp; it&#8217;s already having an impact on a wider audience. We believe arts-based stuff engage people in social matters, such as food crime, where the role of science, here the forensics of food fraud, play a great part in making our world a better place.</p>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<p>Audiences are being encouraged to follow the conversation both in the run up to and during the live shows with #StopFoodCrime.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In June artist <a href="http://terezabuskova.com/" target="_blank">Tereza Buskova</a> will revive a 16th Century English tradition at a Church in Erdington; and she needs your help.</p>
<p><a href="https://clippingthechurch.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Clipping the Church</a> took place once a year when young apprentices and women in service were allowed to visit their families and their ‘mother’ church. Derived from the Anglo-Saxon word ‘clyp-pan’ meaning ‘embrace’ or ‘clasp’, the ceremony is often associated with Mothering Sunday. Church-goers would join hands and move around the outside of the church in an unbroken ring, often singing a traditional hymn. Although there is evidence that the ceremonies took place in Birmingham, it is unknown where.</p>
<p>In her take on the Clipping the Church ceremony, Tereza will explore the tradition in a new performance and video work exploring motherhood, the meaning of rituals, family ties and relationships with the local community. As part of the ceremony baked goods will be paraded. She is asking people to make salt dough decorations for the performance at workshops in the run up to the event. Try your hand at making beautiful traditional Eastern European plaited doughs, or express what motherhood means to you by using only flour, water and salt &#8211; and see them in the final performance and film.</p>
<p>Workshops take place on the following dates:</p>
<p>Saturday 19 March 2016, 11am-1.30pm &#8211; <a href="http://www.kingstandingfoodcommunity.co.uk" target="_blank">Kingstanding Food Community.</a></p>
<p>Saturday 30 April 2016, 11am-1pm &#8211; <a href="http://www.loafonline.co.uk" target="_blank">Loaf Bakery and Cookery School,</a> Stirchley.</p>
<p>Saturday 14 May 2016, 2.30pm (then a gathering with the artist, films screening + food and drink from 5pm).- <a href="http://www.stbarnabaserdington.org.uk" target="_blank">St Barnabas’ Church</a>, High Street, Birmingham. B23 6SY</p>

<p>Ever been to an opera? I have to admit, I haven&#8217;t. Considering I live in a city that has a wonderful opera company that successfully turns the art form on its head (that involves the local community to a great extent, and has even put on a production that involved a string quartet <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/23/karlheinz-stockhausen-mittwoch-aus-licht-birmingham" target="_blank">flying around in helicopters)</a>, it&#8217;s about time I got round to seeing one of <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk" target="_blank">Birmingham Opera Company</a>&#8216;s productions.</p>
<p>Their next production is Henry Purcell’s &#8216;Dido and Aeneas&#8217;. Based on Book IV of Virgil&#8217;s &#8216;Aeneid&#8217;, the opera recounts the love of Dido, Queen of Carthage, for the Trojan hero Aeneas, and her despair when he abandons her. The opera was first performed in 1689.</p>
<p>&#8216;Dido and Aeneas&#8217; runs from 18-23 March in a top secret Birmingham location. Tickets are only a fiver and can be bought <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
