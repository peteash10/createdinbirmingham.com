<p>In the last few years Breakin&#8217; Convention has been increasing their commitment to the development of hip hop theatre as a genre and in particular the support of UK-based companies. Through their education and professional development strands they aim to offer a range of opportunities and platforms as well as connecting companies with Arts Council England, other funding bodies and arts organisations.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of our courses is <strong>Open Art Surgery</strong>, a unique intensive masterminded by Breakin&#8217; Convention Artistic Director and hip hop theatre pioneer, Jonzi D for professional hip hop artists to engage and understand hip hop theatre better. Open to dancers, DJs, beatboxers, emcees, musicians and graffiti artists, participants receive training, mentorship and studio space to experiment and create new works in progress.  This culminates in the Open Art Surgery performance at the end of the week where the results are shared to a live audience who are then invited to critique, question and feedback to the artists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Birmingham Hippodrome continues their dedication to supporting hip hop by partnering Breakin&#8217; Convention to deliver Birmingham&#8217;s first ever Open Art Surgery in July. Jonzi will be joined by co-mentor <strong>Soweto Kinch </strong>and will feature local artists including <strong>Mad Flow</strong>, <strong>Marso Riviere</strong>, <strong>NeneTaps (MDK), Marius and Andrei (MDK),</strong> <strong>DJ Psykhomantus,</strong> <strong>RTKAL</strong> and <strong>Sticky Toffee.</strong></p>
<p>The live event will be hosted by Jonzi D alongside Birmingham&#8217;s award winning jazz musician Soweto Kinch as they introduce the fresh new work developed during the week. Expect to see the very best in breaking, popping, locking, rapping and turntablism chewed up and given a theatrical overhaul.  Birmingham Hippodrome and Breakin&#8217; Convention&#8217;s commitment to offering high quality theatre at an affordable price is evident in the £5 ticket price.</p>
<p><strong>The Open Art Surgery performance takes place on Saturday 20 July 2013, 7.45pm at Patrick Centre, Hurst Street, Birmingham, B5, 4TB. </strong></p>
<p>Tickets are available from the <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/default.asp?Id=441&amp;sC=page1">Hippodrome&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://phillblake.squarespace.com/">Phill Blake</a> has done a rather good job of describing himself on his website, so I&#8217;ll let him take over:</p>
<blockquote><p>Phill Blake is an artist, designer and an illustrator from middle England who refuses to be tied down to one specific genre preferring to spread his talents over multiple art forms and retain an ever evolving style that is all terrain and knows no boundaries. His influences lie in street art, comics, hip hop or urban culture and the different sub cultures that emerge around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>His site&#8217;s also packed full of lots of lovely examples of his work like this one:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was leaving the Electric yesterday having seen the excellent <a href="http://www.planetbboy.com/">Planet B-Boy</a> I was handed a  brochure for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bassfestival.co.uk/">BASS Festival</a>, happening across the East Midlands over June.</p>

</ul>

He&#8217;s emailed to say that his dad was annoyed at not having tea with the Queen!  Ammo&#8217;s sent over a pic of his dad with some beefeaters though &#8211; nice shoes.</p>
