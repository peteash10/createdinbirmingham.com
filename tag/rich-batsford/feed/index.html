				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Andrew Dubber" href="http://andrewdubber.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Dubber</a>, <a title="Jon Cotton" href="http://www.artisanaudio.com/" target="_blank">Jon Cotton</a>, <a title="Robin Valk" href="http://radiotogo.com/" target="_blank">Robin Valk</a>, <a title="John Mostyn" href="http://johnmostyn.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">John Mostyn</a> and <a title="Lisa Meyer" href="http://twitter.com/supersonicfest" target="_blank">Lisa Meyer</a> were  all kind enough to share their perspective and ideas for this post &#8211; I&#8217;ll publish their comments in full on my blog so none are wasted. I also drew, with permission, on the Birmingham Music Network&#8217;s recent <a title="10 Questions survey" href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/2011/03/05/10-questions-for-birminghams-independent-music-industry-your-answers-please/" target="_blank">10 Questions survey</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Unparalleled Riches</strong></p>
<p>The comments on the current state of the scene were very encouraging, suggesting there&#8217;s more quality, active musicians in the city than ever before and a number of hardworking and creative promoters as well.</p>
<p>So what improvements might be made to encourage some of the many talented and dedicated individuals and groups to progress further on a professional and national level?</p>
<p><strong>Venues and Noise Abatement</strong></p>
<p>We picked out Kings Heath&#8217;s Hare &amp; Hounds as an example of what a good  local music venue can be (great location, facilities, standard of acts  and size of audiences) but felt there&#8217;s too few live music venues around  for a city and scene of our size.</p>
<p>Recent issues between property developers, the council and independent venues such as  the Fiddle &amp; Bone, the Spotted Dog, the Nightingale and most  recently the Rainbow and Moseley&#8217;s Price of Wales are all situations in  which the city and the community have had the opportunity to act clearly in favour of culture over profit &#8211; if we are to have the courage of our  convictions going forward, common sense prevailing in any similar situation is of vital importance.</p>
<p>Jon Cotton suggests that these issues could very often be solved by small grants  for acoustic improvements to venues &#8211; possibly around £1000 per venue  for simple materials and an hour or two&#8217;s consultancy with an  acoustician.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Festivals</strong></p>
<p>We are fortunate to have some small, quality festivals such as <a title="Moseley Folk" href="http://www.moseleyfolk.co.uk/" target="_blank">Moseley Folk</a> and <a title="Supersonic" href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/supersonic/" target="_blank">Supersonic</a> and efforts should be made to support them as needed as well as identify other existing and emerging festivals and support them too. On the  larger scale, Gigbeth was admired but perhaps fell short of its full potential, whilst the value of ArtsFest is questionable due to its very broad reach and the policy of not paying artists.</p>
<p>Organisational issues aside, a Festival lives or dies on the quality of its curation &#8211; there is a lot of experienced promoters in Birmingham and they are a  resource that should be tapped as much as possible by any future large  scale efforts. As valuable as good intentions might be, its quality that ultimately counts.</p>
<p><strong>Media Support</strong></p>
<p>It seems bizarre that our local radio stations do so little to engage with the local music community. This is both our loss and theirs, since, as  little more than pale imitations of much bigger national operations, their audience figures are dropping rapidly. So its to the grass roots that we might best look to the future. Rhubarb Radio is steadily  expanding with well programmed and sequenced automated play lists  offering a variety of moods at different parts of the day combined with  programmes presented by fast developing local talent and all using West Midlands music. Support for Rhubarb and the likes of South Birmingham Community Radio should be encouraged and need not be financial.</p>
<p>Likewise in the world of print media, the Birmingham Post is down to a weekly and the  Evening Mail, whilst its news coverage is ultra local doesn&#8217;t seem to cover local talent until they are proven on the national stage. Fortunately, we have Indies such as <a title="Area" href="http://areamagazine.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Area</a>, <a title="Brumnotes" href="http://www.brumnotes.com/" target="_blank">Brumnotes</a>, <a title="Radar" href="http://www.theradarmagazine.co.uk/" target="_blank">Radar</a> and <a title="Night Times" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=35836117497" target="_blank">Night Times</a> taking up the slack.</p>
<p><strong>Focal Web Presence</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s good stuff going on the web such as <a href="http://www.livebrum.co.uk/" target="_blank">Live Brum</a> (for listings), review and photos from <a href="http://www.brumlive.com/" target="_blank">Brum Live</a>, long running bloggers such as <a href="http://russl.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Russ L</a>, <a href="http://www.thehearingaid.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Hearing Aid</a>, the directory and blog at <a href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Birmingham Music Network</a>, a terrific playable online library of music at the <a href="http://www.pilot-project.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pilot Project</a> and archive projects such as the <a title="Birmingham Music Archive" href="http://birminghammusicarchive.co.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Music Archive</a> and <a title="Home of Metal" href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/" target="_blank">Home of Metal</a>.</p>
<p>That said, I still feel something is lacking which could be well filled by something modelled on Created in Birmingham. CiB rarely mentions music for the  good reason that if it covered every decent new album, gig or video, music would completely swamp the other content. Is there a case for a sister Music in Birmingham site?</p>
<p><strong>Facilitation, Not Control</strong></p>
<p>Its very tempting to try and fix things with big, top down initiatives, but often they fail to deliver and given the current financial climate, there&#8217;s not likely to be much public money around for a while. Andrew Dubber suggests that the smartest thing that could be done now is to identify and support already existing and naturally forming scenes and connections, and draw goals and strategies from those communities&#8217; own ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Proud to be Independent</strong></p>
<p>A lot of very exciting music and events are happening through the efforts of people taking initiative and responsibility for their own success. We should be proud and encouraging of this rather than waiting for an  authority figure from either the public or private sector to come along  and validate our efforts with an official seal of approval. John Mostyn goes so far as to suggest that a small pot of public funding should be used to encourage the term &#8216;Unsigned&#8217; to never be used within the City in any way, shape or form by anyone&#8230; ever.</p>
<p><strong>Cherish Diversity</strong></p>
<p>The  diversity of our music and culture may have slowed progress towards a  cohesive and structured scene or community, but maybe that very  diversity has the capability to power us forward to a time of  unparalleled musical output and cultural harmony.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the cockles of my heart &#8211; how they are warmed.</p>
<p>Created in Birmingham doesn&#8217;t tend to cover comedy very much although, as people have pointed out, there&#8217;s no lack of creativity going on with it.Â  The problem is that, although I come across plenty of listings, there&#8217;s been no-one (that I&#8217;ve found) writing passionately and consistently about the city&#8217;s comedy scene.</p>
<p>Until now &#8211; enter <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">Who&#8217;s Laughing Now?</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" rel="lightbox[2157]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2158" title="whoslaughingnow" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="408" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With news, listings, features and a kind of curation area for YouTube vids, it&#8217;s been launched to coincide with the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> and is the brainchild of Rich Batsford and Simon Harper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.richbatsford.com/?p=309">Rich explains on his own blog</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The site has been created with the intent of developing the comedy scene in the area and is more or less an open forum &#8211; we are very happy for all local promoters to send in previews of their events.</p>
<p>We are also on the lookout for other writers or budding journalists who are interested in publishing reviews through the site. Whilst thereâ€™s no money on offer, its all good experience and we would expect to be able to get free show tickets for our contributors when they are reviewing a show. Are you interested? &#8211; please <a href="mailto:info@whoslaughingnow.org">contact us</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really chuffed to see this and think there&#8217;s a whole heap of potential here, so good luck to them.</p>
