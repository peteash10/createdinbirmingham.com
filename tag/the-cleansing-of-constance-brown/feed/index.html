				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to see <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/project-constance-brown.html">Stan&#8217;s Cafe&#8217;s <em>The Cleansing of Constance Brown</em></a> at AE Harris on Saturday.

<p>It&#8217;s probably better to go with no expectations/preconceptions of about what you&#8217;re about to see but, in case you&#8217;d rather take someone else&#8217;s word for how it good it is:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t make any new year resolutions, but if I did &#8216;go to more theatre in 2011&#8217; might have been on there. On Saturday I ticked that box good n hard, clocking up the Rep, the Hippodrome and the Old Rep before 5pm.</p>
<p><strong>The Rep &#8211; <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/the-final-curtain">The Final Curtain</a></strong></p>
<p>The Rep&#8217;s closing for a couple of years while they finish off the new library (which will integrate with the Rep to a fair degree). They&#8217;ll be touring around venues across Birmingham but before then they held one last little event. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Malin">Joanne Malin</a> hosted and <a href="http://www.homeofpolar.com/">Polarbear</a> had written a piece for the audience to perform with some help from performers from the Young Rep.</p>
<p>It was short, sweet and good, wholesome fun and a nice way to see off the current place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="The Final Curtain at The Rep by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/5342792547/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5283/5342792547_f895e8bf7c.jpg" alt="The Final Curtain at The Rep" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>They were doing backstage tours after that but we didn&#8217;t have time for that because we wanted to go and see&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Birmingham Hippodrome &#8211; <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/default.asp?Id=399&amp;sC=page1">(re)Stretch</a></strong></p>
<p>This was ace. I went to a little preview on Friday night and it was so good I went back on Saturday. (re)Stretch answers the question &#8216;how much fun would it be to string up 8 miles(!) of fine elastic to make a 10 metre-wide screen and then project things on to it and make it make noise too?&#8217;. The answer is, of course &#8216;very fun&#8217;, especially as you&#8217;re encouraged to get involved and play with the thing.</p>
<p>At the preview on Friday a couple of dancers cavorted in and around the piece (it&#8217;s presented in association with <a href="http://www.dancexchange.org.uk/">DanceXchange</a>), which was lovely, but they were no match for the unrestrained glee shown by a class of young ballet dancers on Saturday when they were let loose on it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s free and it&#8217;s there until Sunday 16 January. Martin Pickard&#8217;s taken some lovely pics from the Friday which <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ropemonkey/sets/72157625772077138/show/">you can see in this slideshow</a>:</p>

<p><strong>The Old Rep &#8211; <a href="http://www.oldreptheatre.org.uk/more.asp?ID=129">The Firework Maker&#8217;s Daughter</a></strong></p>
<p>We managed to score some tickets to this at the last minute, leading to the admission that I&#8217;d never actually been to the Old Rep before. It&#8217;s a good place and the staff were very nice and friendly. The show itself (written by Philip Pullman) was more kiddy-friendly than the sort of thing I&#8217;m used to (this was the Christmas show, after all) but it was entertaining enough &#8211; the elephant costumes were ace and it had a good energy about it.</p>
<p><strong>Also on a theatrical tip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stan&#8217;s Cafe are doing an <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/shop.html">earlybird ticket offer for The Cleansing of Constance Brown</a> at AE Harris from 1 to 19 March</li>
<li>The first show of The Rep&#8217;s next peripatetical two years is <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/the-rememberers">The Rememberers</a> on 4 February, also at AE Harris. It&#8217;s a &#8216;classic tale of good versus evil, told through rap narration, lyrics, projection, music and graphic novel illustration&#8217; which sounds good to me</li>
</ul>
