				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had an email:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been asked to support the children in need appeal and I would like to get a Pudsey the Bear figure carved out of a 25kg block of cheese.<br />
Can you help?<br />
Can you give me a call if this is something you could do.<br />
The event is being held next Friday the 14th November in the Asda store in Wolverhampton.<br />
I can get the cheese to you by next Monday the 10th</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s not something I can help with personally, so I thought I&#8217;d open this up to CiB&#8217;s readers.Â  I&#8217;ve no reason to believe this isn&#8217;t genuine, by the way (there&#8217;s a name and mobile number attached in the full email).</p>
<p>If anyone can help then email me at the normal address and I&#8217;ll pass on your details.Â  Don&#8217;t get in touch if you just fancy 25kg of cheese.</p>
<p>To illustrate this post, and given the recent fuss over the pond, I present the signing of the Declaration of Independence in cheese form:</p>
