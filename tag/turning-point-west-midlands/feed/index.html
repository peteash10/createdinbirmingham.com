&#8220;The challenge for arts organisations outside London is to embrace the blogosphere, and fast. I think we need to work hard to nurture the brave souls who are often spending their free time running what&#8217;s-on sites and blogs – invite them to our shows, treat them like proper journalists, buy them lunch, encourage our suppliers to buy advertising space on their websites, link to their sites from ours and so on. If we help listings sites and blogs to grow, we&#8217;re safeguarding the future of arts criticism.&#8221;</li>

<p>On 8 November <a href="http://tpwm.squarespace.com/">Turning Point West Midlands</a> will be hosting Voice Your Vision at <a href="http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/">The New Art Gallery Walsall</a> from 10am &#8211; 4pm.</p>
<p>With the opportunity to discuss and debate the future of visual arts in the West Midlands, this event aims to find and prioritize ways of strengthening the visual arts in light of recent cuts to the sector.</p>
<blockquote><p>In these challenging times it is important that we play to our strengths that those in visual arts come together as a collective voice.  Artists are at the heart of Turning Point West Midlands and we hope you, along with arts organisations – studios, galleries and museums, come together to discuss and steer the way forward for the visual arts strategy within the region.</p></blockquote>
<p>The event is free and refreshments will be served. To confirm your attendance email: <a href="mailto:jane.morrow@bcu.ac.uk">jane.morrow@bcu.ac.uk</a></p>
