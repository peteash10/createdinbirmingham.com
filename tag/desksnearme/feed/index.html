				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to a meeting earlier that was broadly to do with how arts organisations can share resources and collaborate. One of the case studies looked at how <a href="http://www.sampad.org.uk/">sampad</a> and <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a> work together in various ways.</p>
<p>One of the things from their presentation that set pens scribbling was the idea of shared office space, the benefits that have come as a result and the plans to develop it a bit more.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good idea to me. I share an office with <a href="http://www.substrakt.co.uk">Substrakt</a> (actually, it&#8217;s their office) and <a href="http://podnosh.com">Podnosh</a> and there&#8217;s a steady turnover of various freelancers who have come and gone over the past couple of years including <a href="http://www.kate-beatty.co.uk/">Kate Beatty</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/skyhook">Chris Bates</a> and <a href="http://peteashton.com/">Pete Ashton</a>. Currently we have <a href="http://carolinebeavon.com/">Caroline Beavon</a> and <a href="http://www.amarus.co.uk/">Daniel Davies</a> in here. It&#8217;s been really useful to share space with film makers, photographers, web developers, designers and others.</p>
<p>So yes, good idea.</p>
<p><strong>A couple of options</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a spare desk and you like the idea of making that available to someone (for free or not) then:</p>
<ul>
<li>List it on <a href="http://desksnear.me/">DesksNear.Me</a>, a lovely new service that&#8217;s been set up for just this sort of thing. There&#8217;s nowhere listed in the Birmingham area yet</li>
<li>Put it onÂ <a href="http://jobplot.co.uk/">Jobplot</a>. Get a profile on the site (it&#8217;s free) then add your available desk space to the <a href="http://jobplot.co.uk/opportunities/">Opportunities</a> board</li>
</ul>
<p>DesksNear.Me is open to everyone, Jobplot is aimed at creative companies and individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Other options</strong></p>
<p>There are of course plenty of places where you can rent desk/office space around the city (cow-orking spaces, serviced offices, etc) and a few others where, for the price of a few coffees, you can get all the wifi you can eat.</p>
