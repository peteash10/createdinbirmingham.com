<p style="text-align: justify;">With all the build-up and enthusiasm for dance performances during <a title="Get Your Dancing Shoes – IDFB 2014" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2014/04/26/idfb-2014/" target="_blank">IDFB</a> I feel well and truly ready for BE Festival 2014. Having not personally attended <a title="The first BE Festival" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/08/the-first-be-festival/" target="_blank">BE Festival</a> before I was a little unsure of what to expect, and so took the opportunity to visit the 2014 launch at Birmingham Rep on the 16<sup>th</sup> April. I was quickly immersed into a world of acting, exciting workshops and performers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BE Festival has been hosted in Birmingham since 2010 after responding to an Arts Council-hosted conference entitled, ‘The Challenge of Change: How can we make a better future for theatre, here in the West Midlands?’ in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5 years on, the realised dream of BE Festival still continues. Having invited performers from 11 different countries to take part in this years’ amazing selection of 22 performances, the festival has already attracted a large following.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/93095334"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/teatro-sotterraneo.jpg" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year The Rep will open their doors to BE Festival, with the main stage itself set to feature a pop-up restaurant. There they will be serving delicious interval dinners to artists and audiences so that they can have an opportunity to eat together each evening. The menus include vegetarian options and advance bookings for this are now available through box-office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://befestival.org/festival/dinner-2014/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/restaurant.jpg" width="448" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ll now be able to see all of the wonderful events planned which include visual arts and talks, workshops, performances and even musical post-show events, finishing with an Awards Party on the 12th of July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even better, if you’d like a chance to be involved with BE Festival, meeting the performers and organisers behind the action then you might be interested in their <a href="http://befestival.org/get-involved/volunteers/" target="_blank">volunteering opportunities</a>. Open until the 12<sup>th</sup> of May, volunteering opportunities with BE Festival also include 6 positions for aspiring stage managers/technicians to form part of the Production Team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to volunteer please send an email detailing your interest, any relevant skills, experience and CV to emmahalsteadbe@gmail.com. Volunteers will be needed in May and then throughout June and July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the full 2014 programme please see <a href="http://befestival.org/festival/programme-2014/">HERE</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t make any new year resolutions, but if I did &#8216;go to more theatre in 2011&#8217; might have been on there. On Saturday I ticked that box good n hard, clocking up the Rep, the Hippodrome and the Old Rep before 5pm.</p>
<p><strong>The Rep &#8211; <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/the-final-curtain">The Final Curtain</a></strong></p>
<p>The Rep&#8217;s closing for a couple of years while they finish off the new library (which will integrate with the Rep to a fair degree). They&#8217;ll be touring around venues across Birmingham but before then they held one last little event. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Malin">Joanne Malin</a> hosted and <a href="http://www.homeofpolar.com/">Polarbear</a> had written a piece for the audience to perform with some help from performers from the Young Rep.</p>
<p>It was short, sweet and good, wholesome fun and a nice way to see off the current place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="The Final Curtain at The Rep by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/5342792547/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5283/5342792547_f895e8bf7c.jpg" alt="The Final Curtain at The Rep" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>They were doing backstage tours after that but we didn&#8217;t have time for that because we wanted to go and see&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Birmingham Hippodrome &#8211; <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/default.asp?Id=399&amp;sC=page1">(re)Stretch</a></strong></p>
<p>This was ace. I went to a little preview on Friday night and it was so good I went back on Saturday. (re)Stretch answers the question &#8216;how much fun would it be to string up 8 miles(!) of fine elastic to make a 10 metre-wide screen and then project things on to it and make it make noise too?&#8217;. The answer is, of course &#8216;very fun&#8217;, especially as you&#8217;re encouraged to get involved and play with the thing.</p>
<p>At the preview on Friday a couple of dancers cavorted in and around the piece (it&#8217;s presented in association with <a href="http://www.dancexchange.org.uk/">DanceXchange</a>), which was lovely, but they were no match for the unrestrained glee shown by a class of young ballet dancers on Saturday when they were let loose on it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s free and it&#8217;s there until Sunday 16 January. Martin Pickard&#8217;s taken some lovely pics from the Friday which <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ropemonkey/sets/72157625772077138/show/">you can see in this slideshow</a>:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fropemonkey%2Fsets%2F72157625772077138%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fropemonkey%2Fsets%2F72157625772077138%2F&amp;set_id=72157625772077138&amp;jump_to=" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fropemonkey%2Fsets%2F72157625772077138%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fropemonkey%2Fsets%2F72157625772077138%2F&amp;set_id=72157625772077138&amp;jump_to="></embed></object></p>
<p><strong>The Old Rep &#8211; <a href="http://www.oldreptheatre.org.uk/more.asp?ID=129">The Firework Maker&#8217;s Daughter</a></strong></p>
<p>We managed to score some tickets to this at the last minute, leading to the admission that I&#8217;d never actually been to the Old Rep before. It&#8217;s a good place and the staff were very nice and friendly. The show itself (written by Philip Pullman) was more kiddy-friendly than the sort of thing I&#8217;m used to (this was the Christmas show, after all) but it was entertaining enough &#8211; the elephant costumes were ace and it had a good energy about it.</p>
<p><strong>Also on a theatrical tip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stan&#8217;s Cafe are doing an <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/shop.html">earlybird ticket offer for The Cleansing of Constance Brown</a> at AE Harris from 1 to 19 March</li>
<li>The first show of The Rep&#8217;s next peripatetical two years is <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/the-rememberers">The Rememberers</a> on 4 February, also at AE Harris. It&#8217;s a &#8216;classic tale of good versus evil, told through rap narration, lyrics, projection, music and graphic novel illustration&#8217; which sounds good to me</li>
</ul>
