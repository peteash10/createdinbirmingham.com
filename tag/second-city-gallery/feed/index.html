Nice to have Fused back and blogging.  They&#8217;ve spotted that Simon &amp; Tom Bloor and Juneau Projects were commissioned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the roundel</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spaghettigazetti.com/2008/10/artist-studios-to-rent.html">Second City Gallery looking for resident artists</a><br />
Mark Wilkinson and Sophie Handy weren&#8217;t impressed with a lack of collectively rentable, large studio/exhibition spaces so they&#8217;ve found their own.  Give them a call if you&#8217;re interested in getting involved</li>
<li><a href="http://creativelaunchpad.wordpress.com/free-training/">FREE training &#8211; Creative Launchpad</a><br />
Want to attend a course called &#8220;Business Planning for a Successful Creative Business&#8221;? You&#8217;re in luck&#8230;</li>

<li><a href="http://plusdesignexpo.blogspot.com/2008/10/plus-touring-city-with-walking-tours.html">Plus+ Touring the city with the Walking Tours</a><br />
I seem to remember the walking tours of Birmingham, with historian Ben Waddington as the guide, went down very well last year. Here are the plans for this year</li>
