				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a bit of a debate about Created in Birmingham going on over at <a href="http://daveharte.com/birmingham/created-in-birmingham-time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">Dave Harte&#8217;s blog</a>. It has been suggested that CiB has lost a bit of &#8216;umpf&#8217; of late, that it may have strayed from it&#8217;s original purpose, or is lacking that special something that made it what it was. I am keen to get some of the regular readers in on the debate. I would be really interested to hear your feedback, warts and all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3207 aligncenter" title="google-map" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google-map.jpg" alt="google-map" width="398" height="211" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google-map.jpg 499w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google-map-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>
<p>In light of this, I wanted to let you know some things I am working on at the moment. I&#8217;m going to be changing the aesthetic of the blog, and changing the template we use. I&#8217;ll be using a free, downloadable templateÂ  just as Pete did when he first created CiB. I will be doing this for several reasons, one simply because I am not a technical person and wouldn&#8217;t have a clue how to design or adapt my own, but mostly because I want to encourage others to start blogs by using these free tools that are available to anyone.</p>
<p>I am also working on a great big CiB Google Map of Birmingham. As a reader of CiB one question has always stuck with me: &#8220;That gallery / project / meetup / exhibition looks great, but where the hell is it?&#8221; When putting this map together and encouraging others to contribute, I am hoping to find lots of exciting stuff happening all over the city; it&#8217;s suburbs and back streets, North &amp; South. I have been partly inspired by Nicky Getgood&#8217;s: <a href="http://digbeth.org/maps-and-photos/arty-trail/" target="_blank">Digbeth is Good Arty Trail</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the map should be a comprehensive documentation of creativity in Birmingham, but a rich working document which evolves over time with many contributors adding locations, photographs, video and trails.</p>
