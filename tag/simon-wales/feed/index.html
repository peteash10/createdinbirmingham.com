				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Birmingham a city where it is easy to collaborate with others?</p>
<p>I arrived in Birmingham in the summer of 2006, tasked with preparing  <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">Town Hall</a> for its anticipated re-opening, due to happen 18 months later  at the end of 2007. Although I had lived in the Midlands during my  school years, I didn’t really know Birmingham, and so had no idea how it  would feel to live and work in the City, despite the reassurances from a  few friendly faces I knew prior to my arrival.</p>
<p>Since then, I have worked closely with my colleague Paul Keene (Director  of Programming for THSH) to build new relationships with artists,  producers, promoters, other arts organisations, and civic and community  groups.  The most refreshing aspect of working in Birmingham has been  experiencing just how easy it is to meet people and “do business”.   Despite the huge amount of creative work taking place here, I quickly  found that everyone knows everyone, and really there’s no excuse not to  be working together and sharing ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/page/town-hall-birmingham/town-hall-image-gallery/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9509" title="Town Hall" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall-.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="263" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall-.jpg 712w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall--300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></a><br />
Our approach has always been to get out of Town Hall and to try and see  as many other things as possible, both to support the work of others,  but also to get a real understanding of how <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">THSH</a> fits into the creative  network of the City.  When your day job is overseeing a hall which  presents 300 different events a year, it’s important to remember to get  off the daily hamster wheel and make the time to meet with colleagues  from other arts organisations, as that tends to be how the interesting  new ideas and projects begin to take shape.</p>
<p>This week, Town Hall have hosted <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a> and <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/home/">Flatpack</a> in two exciting events  (<a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/mirror-mirror-the-irrepressibles">The Irrepressibles</a>, and <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/digging-for-gold">Digging For Gold</a>), and we are very proud to be  involved as partners in both festivals. The Irrepressibles show came  about because Laura from Fierce and I were both at a previous  Irrepressibles show in St Martin’s Church as part of last year’s <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/">SHOUT  Queer Festival</a>, and we were both blown away by what we heard. A couple  of quick discussions later, and a chat with Jamie from the  Irrepressibles, and we had agreed to jointly work together to bring the  group back to Birmingham for Fierce. With Flatpack, we have always kept  in touch with Ian and Pip, and following their big <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/2009/festival/event/curzonora">Curzonora</a> project two  years ago, we were keen to work with them to bring another Flatpack  project to Town Hall. By taking our successful existing silent film with  organ accompaniment format, and adapting it to include improvised piano  and some shorter films, we have been able to add to Flatpack’s focus  this year on archivist Iris Barry.</p>
<p>We are also preparing for our major <a href="http://www.symphonyhall.co.uk/page/contact-us/press-office/stravinsky-s-rite-of-spring-3d/">Rite of Spring 3D project</a>, taking  place on April 21st, and performed by the <a href="http://www.cbso.co.uk/">CBSO</a> with dancer Julia Mach  and artistic director Klaus Obermaier. We have made the financial  commitment to ensure that this extraordinary project is presented in  Birmingham, but as always, we want to work with our partners to ensure  that all the potential audiences get to hear about it, and we don’t  serve Birmingham audiences best by just doing that by ourselves.</p>
<p>That approach to the marketing strategy for the Rite of Spring project  runs through all of our work at THSH – we will always work with partners  wherever we can, whether it is us guaranteeing the fees and costs for a  project, or through more straightforward marketing and  cross-promotional relationships.  For example, if we are promoting The  Dhol Foundation in concert at Town Hall, we will work with <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/">The Drum</a>, <a href="http://www.sampad.org.uk/"> sampad</a>, <a href="http://punch-records.co.uk/">Punch</a>, <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/music-service">Birmingham Music Service</a> and independent promoters to  ensure that we utilise as many avenues as possible to spread the word on  the show, and to help develop an audience for the artists. We are also  talking to the <a href="http://www.birminghamjazz.co.uk/">Birmingham Jazz</a> team on a weekly basis, sharing ideas for  future projects, and working together to promote performances such as  the recent Uri Caine/Mahler concert, as part of the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/the-birmingham-mahler-cycle">Birmingham Mahler  Cycle</a>.</p>
<p>On a national basis, we’re working with promoters and festivals  including <a href="http://www.serious.org.uk/">Serious</a>, who collaborate with us to ensure that artists  including Mariza, Staff Benda Bilili and Salif Keita are performing in  Birmingham as part of their limited UK tour plans. Serious and other  promoters who represent touring artists are keen to include Birmingham,  but this will only happen if an organisation like THSH is prepared to  invest and commit to the artists, as these concerts rarely stand up on a  purely commercial arrangement.</p>
<p>So, back to my original question – is Birmingham a city where it is easy  to collaborate with others?  Five years on, we can look back over a  very broad range of collaborations, some of which were for one-off  occasions, and some which have since evolved into an ongoing  relationship. I believe that collaboration is definitely one of the  things that Birmingham does best, and we should be proud of what we can  achieve by working together.</p>
