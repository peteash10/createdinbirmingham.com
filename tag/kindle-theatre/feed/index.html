				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kindletheatre/status/101891609515405312"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10304" title="KindleTheatre" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KindleTheatre.png" alt="KindleTheatre" width="600" height="204" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KindleTheatre.png 600w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KindleTheatre-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken me a few years to finally get round to going to <a href="http://www.pilotnights.co.uk/">Pilot</a>. I&#8217;m not sure whether to kick myself for missing so many or pat myself on the back for finally making it along (what the heck, it&#8217;s the end of the week so I&#8217;ll go for the latter).</p>
<p>There was a packed audience (extra chairs had to be fetched twice), a great atmosphere and some good (and as yet unfinished) work on show from <a title="Little Earthquake" href="http://www.little-earthquake.com">Little Earthquake</a>, <a title="Hamfisted!" href="http://www.hamfisted.org.uk/">Hamfisted!</a>, <a href="http://www.louiseland.co.uk">LouDeemY Productions</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Heart-of-the-Anchor/192144547471724">Heart of the Anchor</a>, Alex Brockie and <a title="Rebekka Platt" href="http://rebekkaplatt.co.cc/">Rebekka Platt</a>.</p>
<p>I have to admit to being a bit surprised by how many people had turned out for it, and not just in light of recent events around the city centre. From what I could make out the audience was a mixed and supportive crowd of fellow performers, friends/family and theatre fans. Folks from <a title="Friction Arts" href="http://www.frictionarts.com/">Friction Arts</a>, <a title="Fierce Festival" href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce Festival</a>, the <a title="Royal Shakespeare Company" href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/">RSC</a> and <a title="Women &amp; Theatre" href="http://www.womenandtheatre.co.uk/">Women &amp; Theatre</a> (among other organisations) were there too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pilotnights.co.uk/">Pilot</a>, by the way is a chance for:</p>
<blockquote><p>a host of theatre companies from the West Midlands region and beyond to share with you their latest artistic doings in an early form. There is a mix of experienced and novice companies, addressing a broad spectrum of ideas, using a wide range of approaches and in the vast expanses of @ A E Harris, there is the chance for a couple of pieces to stretch themselves out</p></blockquote>
<p>It was good and I&#8217;ll be going again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="BE Festival by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/4772279393/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4772279393_1a3076a2dc.jpg" alt="BE Festival" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>On Saturday night I took a couple of (out of town) friends to AE Harris for the <a href="http://www.befestival.org/">Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a>. We turned up a bit late so only managed to catch the last piece &#8211; one which would&#8217;ve been a fantastic spoof on art student theatre if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact they were taking themselves seriously.</p>
<p>Serves us right for turning up late &#8211; I&#8217;m told some of the earlier suff was ace. The night wasn&#8217;t over though, with a reasonably-priced bar, music from the <a href="http://www.tgcollective.com/">TG Collective</a> (in the rather dark pic above), some last-night awards handed to the companies that had performed, the <a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/148249-be-festival-singers">results of the singing workshop</a> from earlier in the day (audio below) and, <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1028">as reported on Stan&#8217;s Cafe&#8217;s blog</a>, music and dancing till dawn.</p>
<p><object id="iefix1" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="129" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="data" value="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" /><param name="scale" value="noscale" /><param name="salign" value="lt" /><param name="bgColor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers.mp3&amp;mp3Author=chrisunitt&amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers&amp;mp3Title=BE+Festival+singers&amp;mp3Time=11.31pm+03+Jul+2010" /><param name="src" value="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" /><embed id="iefix1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="129" src="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" flashvars="mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers.mp3&amp;mp3Author=chrisunitt&amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers&amp;mp3Title=BE+Festival+singers&amp;mp3Time=11.31pm+03+Jul+2010" wmode="window" allowscriptaccess="always" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" salign="lt" scale="noscale" data="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf"></embed></object></p>
<p>Despite some worries about ticket sales in the weeks beforehand, the last couple of nights of the festival were pretty much sold out and the various theatre companies who had come to the city seemed to have enjoyed themselves, with much talk of returning next year.</p>
<p>There was a fantastic atmosphere and my friends went away impressed with the sort of thing that Birmingham gets up to, so well done all who were involved. As <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1028&amp;cpage=1#comment-870">Graeme rightly comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was worth being there for the sense of gathering alone</p></blockquote>
<p>One last thing &#8211; it was a little odd to see AE Harris decked out as a &#8216;proper&#8217; theatre but it scrubs up rather well. I&#8217;ve seen it used for all sorts of things since it opened &#8211; 24HR Scalextric, launch parties, a Christmas party, filled with rice by Stan&#8217;s Cafe and filled with detritus (including upturned cars) by Kindle Theatre. It fills a very important and individual gap in a city that&#8217;s not blessed with mid-size venues, so it&#8217;s encouraging to hear that discussions are ongoing to keep the place open past the initial lease.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next PILOT Night, co-piloted by Kindle Theatre at AE Harris, Birmingham will be on Thursday 1 April 2010. Here&#8217;s some copy/pasted info. For more knowledge, and to apply, go to <a href="http://www.pilotnights.co.uk">www.pilotnights.co.uk</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pilot is a platform for testing new theatre work from the West Midlands and beyond. Deadline for submissions Monday 1st March, 12pm</p>
<p>RELEASE THE BEAST</p>
<p>Had an idea laying dormant for a while that you almost daren&#8217;t wake up? Not sure if it&#8217;s mad or genius?<br />
Kindle invite performers/practitioners/fools to submit ideas for performance which frighten them.  Whether in form, content or style it must push you beyond your comfort zone into unknown territory.</p>
<p>Challenge yourself in a lively, supportive atmosphere and get honest feedback from peers and audience.  All fools will be applauded.</p>
<p>AE Harris is an industrial warehouse in Birmingham&#8217;s Jewelry Quarter. It&#8217;s big, blank and open to you, with four huge spaces and lots of corners, nooks and crannies to test your idea in. Site-specific ideas are most welcome.</p>
<p>We can offer you a small bursary, documentation of your performance, and rehearsal space in the venue from Monday 29th March.</p>
<p>Kindle will also be hosting an unusual meal for all the artists involved on the Wednesday night, in the venue.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other news, on 6 March you should definitely go to Warwick Arts Centre for <a href="http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/season/bite-size">The Bite Size Festival 2010</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>a whirlwind tour of the region&#8217;s theatre, offering you the one-off opportunity to sample a range of great work in one place on the same day.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s lineup includes <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk">Stans Cafe</a>, <a href="http://www.pentabus.co.uk/">Pentabus</a>, <a href="http://www.foursighttheatre.co.uk/">Foursight</a>, <a href="http://www.kindletheatre.co.uk">Kindle</a>, <a href="http://www.janepackman.freeuk.com/">Jane Packman Productions</a>, <a href="http://www.spannertheatre.co.uk/pages/home.html">Spanner</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/newmacho">New Macho</a>, Needle and Thread and Vanessa Oakes. PLUS the first opportunity to see two shows we’ve commissioned especially with Warwick Arts Centre and mac following the First Bite Festival back in November: Caroline Horton’s <em>You’re Not Like The Other Girls Chrissy</em> and <a href="http://www.theuntiedartists.co.uk/Site/Home.html">Untied Artists</a>’ <em>Al Bowlly’s Croon Manifesto</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grab a day ticket and wallow in some entertainingness. Kindle Theatre will be doing 30 mins of <em><a href="http://kindletheatre.co.uk/2009/10/10/eat-your-heart-out-2/">Eat Your Heart Out</a></em>, which I saw last year and thought was really very good indeed.</p>

<p>And plenty more besides, although nine months away from CiB (and a fair amount of time out of the country) meant that I was slightly more  out of touch with some of the smaller-ticket stuff.</p>
<p>What did you enjoy?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a lot of theatre to talk about at the moment. Must be the time of year or something. This looks like being a bit more than theatre though &#8211; &#8220;a performance that invites the audience to literally eat the story&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://kindletheatre.co.uk/?p=124">Kindle Theatre&#8217;s <em>&#8216;Eat Your Heart Out&#8217;</em></a> will be at the AE Harris Building from 29 October to 8 November. I&#8217;m not quite sure how to explain this so I&#8217;m going to do the sensible thing &#8211; quote the promo blurb, post the flyer and suggest you <a href="http://bit.ly/iaXqS">grab a ticket</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last remaining corner of the human world, three cooks are summoned to create a celebratory meal using only the carcass of their once great kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8230;the set will be an apocalyptic junkyard made from Birmingham’s own rubbish and installed by designers Tony Appleby and Claire Wearn. Multimedia design company <a href="http://filmcafe.co.uk/" target="_blank">filmcafe</a> will be creating photographs and lighting inspired by the work of Caravaggio, whilst regional composer-musician Phill Ward will work with Kindle performer-musicians to create a score that reinvents the decadence of the Baroque era. The company are also working food designers <a href="http://www.blanchandshock.com/" target="_blank">Blanch &amp; Shock</a>, to design what promises to be an unforgettable menu</p></blockquote>

Tickets aren&#8217;t all that cheap but <a href="http://stanscafe.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-to-see-and-do.html">James at Stan&#8217;s Cafe reckons</a> it looks like being good value for money:</p>
<blockquote><p>At first glance the casual observer may think the tickets quite dear but there is an insane amount of stuff in the plus, live music and food plus they&#8217;ve been working manically hard for ages on it, so essentially it&#8217;s three nights out in one go and thus good value I would imagine</p></blockquote>
