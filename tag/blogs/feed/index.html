				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you sitting comfortably?  Well, it all started back in March with Dannyâ€™s post about <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/03/18/surface-unsigned" target="_blank">Surface Unsigned</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of months later (on 15 May) Danny received a threatening email from Surface Unsigned which <a href="http://twitter.com/probablydrunk/statuses/812017846" target="_blank">worried him</a>.  After a weekend of checking that CiB had done nothing wrong, the original post was amended and an <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/05/18/surface-unsigned-festival-addendum" target="_blank">addendum</a> was posted.</p>
<p><a href="http://edgetrinkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/surface-unsigned-are-evil-and-other.html" target="_blank">Danny blogged</a> about it, then <a href="http://peteashton.com/2008/05/surface_unsigned_are_fools/" target="_blank">Pete blogged</a> and <a href="http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/?p=52" target="_blank">I blogged</a>.  Then a lovely thing happened &#8211; the blogging community of Birmingham showed their support.  As ever, <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2008/05/surface-unsigned-festival-try-legal-action-against-created-in-birmingham.html" target="_blank">BiNS</a> and <a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=4070" target="_blank">Dâ€™Log</a> were quick on the scene.</p>
<p><a href="http://catherinebray.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/surface-unsigned-hire-lionel-hutz-and-david-baddiel-answers-his-critics/" target="_blank">Cat Bray</a> was amused.  <a href="http://russl.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/the-promoters-of-surface-unsigned-are-pillocks/" target="_blank">Russ L</a> made me laugh.  <a href="http://gdfaf.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/live-music-lovers-beware-surface-unsigned/" target="_blank">Goodfaf Central</a> chipped in. <a href="http://www.birmingham-alive.com/" target="_blank">Birmingham Alive</a> put up a banner.  <a href="http://www.star-one.org.uk/default.asp?postid=165" target="_blank">Simon Gray</a> posted on his blog and on <a href="http://www.thestirrer.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2401" target="_blank">The Stirrer</a> forum where an interview with Surface was promised â€™soonâ€™ (as if that forum and the comments section of an increasing number of blog posts didnâ€™t give them enough space to reply/apologise).</p>
<p>And the blog posts did increase, with contributions from <a href="http://www.brendadada.net/2008/05/surface-unsigned/" target="_blank">Brenda Dada</a>, <a href="http://bobbiejanegardner.com/?p=129" target="_blank">Bobbie Gardner</a>, <a href="http://simonhammond.com/blog/2008/05/19/surface-unsigned/" target="_blank">Si Hammond</a>, <a href="http://pigsonthewing.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/suface-unsigned-to-be-avoided/" target="_blank">Mabblog</a>, <a href="http://carelessgenes.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/somebody-stop-the-bandwagon-i-want-to-get-on/" target="_blank">The Careless Gene</a> (aw, one of my faves), <a href="http://graphiquillan.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/the-dual-arts-of-promotion-and-destruction/" target="_blank">Graphiquillan</a>, <a href="http://artstalking.blogspot.com/2008/05/surface-unsigned-hoo-ha.html" target="_blank">Art Stalking Ana</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/newfolder/2505875934/" target="_blank">New Folder</a>.  Andrew Dubber pondered pay-to-play on <a href="http://newmusicstrategies.com/2008/05/19/is-pay-to-play-ever-a-good-idea/" target="_blank">New Music Strategies</a> while <a href="http://www.antiant.co.uk/2008/05/19/surface-unsigned/" target="_blank">Antonio Roberts</a> got visual.</p>
<p>Dave Harte got forensic on his <a href="http://www.thestirrer.co.uk/bands-can-battle-for-a-price-2005081.html" target="_blank">Birmingham Post blog</a>, revealing who was behind Surface, shortly before the <a href="http://www.thestirrer.co.uk/bands-can-battle-for-a-price-2005081.html" target="_blank">interview on The Stirrer</a> appeared with the representative of Surface asking not to be identified (hello to Jay, probably). The interview discussed pay-to-play but not sending unnecessarily aggressive emails. <a href="http://daveharte.com/?p=26" target="_blank">Dave Harte</a> cross-posted to his own blog, where <a href="http://nunovo.org.uk/" target="_blank">dp</a> wisely commented that</p>
<blockquote><p>itâ€™s interesting watching this thing unfold, partly because itâ€™s going through phases, where the first reaction was indignation, then organised criticism, then more reflective stuff</p></blockquote>
<p>Widening the social media net, several people tagged the story on <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/20094cea643513f77cbd34c33e3fb6e5" target="_blank">delicious</a> including <a href="http://digg.com/world_news/Surface_Unsigned_Festival_nasty_litigious_pay_to_play_bull" target="_blank">Joanna Geary</a> and <a href="http://www.catnipmusic.co.uk/2008/05/20/links-for-2008-05-20/" target="_blank">Catnip</a>, who deployed the word â€˜nastygramâ€™ to devastating effect.</p>
<p>Then things started moving away from Birmingham.  First to Oxford (<a href="http://www.oxfordbands.com/" target="_blank">OxfordBands</a>), then Yorkshire (<a href="http://rhbfictions.blogspot.com/2008/05/surface-unsigned-big-companys-online.html" target="_blank">fictions</a>) and then on to the national music site <a href="http://www.culturedeluxe.com/news_item.asp?id=4193" target="_blank">Culturedeluxe</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of the day Danny was feeling <a href="http://twitter.com/probablydrunk/statuses/815194765" target="_blank">much happier</a>.</p>
<p>But it didnâ€™t stop there, with <a href="http://benneal.blogspot.com/2008/05/causing-stir-on-surface.html" target="_blank">Ben Neal</a> (who once played at Surface) saying hi. <a href="http://thegetgoodguide.wordpress.com/2008/05/21/suface-unsigned-is-not-so-grate-achully/" target="_blank">The Getgood Guide</a> got with the LOLspeak.  <a href="http://www.steflewandowski.com/2008/05/surface-unsigned/" target="_blank">Stef</a> examined what Surface should perhaps have done (executive summary &#8211; anything but what they did) and even the <a href="http://forums.mirror.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=22265&amp;highlight=surface+unsigned" target="_blank">Daily Mirror</a>â€™s forum received the good news.  <a href="http://blog.paulthewlis.com/dailylinks/links-for-2008-05-20/" target="_blank">Paul Thewlis</a> threw a link in, as did <a href="http://whoknowswherethoughtscomefrom.blogspot.com/2008/05/below-surface.html" target="_blank">Who Knows Where Thoughts Come From</a>. Dunc from the <a href="http://blog.theautumnstore.co.uk/archives/83" target="_blank">Autumn Store</a> says we donâ€™t need battle-of-the-band contests.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Todayâ€™s the day weâ€™re supposed to take down the original post. Weâ€™re not going to, obviously &#8211; Dannyâ€™s still not even received an apology.</p>
<p>However, as far as CiBâ€™s concerned I intend to draw a line under the matter with this post (the comments are still open of course). Itâ€™s been fun but weâ€™ve made our point. I for one would rather turn my attention to the many positive things happening in Birmingham (although every time I Google â€˜Surface Unsignedâ€™ I stare hungrily at all the forums that appear).</p>
<p>Iâ€™d just like to say thanks to those who have offered support, kind words and legal advice over the past few days. Youâ€™re beautiful people.</p>
