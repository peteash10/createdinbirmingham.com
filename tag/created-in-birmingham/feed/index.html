				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have noticed a strange and unfamiliar name on your <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/">Created in Birmingham</a> posts in recent weeks, so I think it&#8217;s about time I emerged from the shadows and said hello&#8230;</p>
<p>Hi! I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ravonski">Ian Ravenscroft</a> and I&#8217;ve joined the CiB team to (hopefully) continue the blog&#8217;s sterling work in unearthing Birmingham&#8217;s artistic and creative gems.</p>
<p>I was created in Birmingham myself, I&#8217;m a former journalist, and I&#8217;m now a producer at <a href="http://www.meshedmedia.com/">Meshed Media</a> working with current CiB editor <a href="http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/">Chris Unitt</a>. I&#8217;m also a writer with comedy and animation collective <a href="http://www.diceproductions.co.uk/">Dice Productions</a> and had a hand in founding and running <a href="http://www.filmforumwm.co.uk">Film Forum West Midlands</a> too.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s me. So, if you see me out and about, do say hello. Or if you have any news, events, places or people you&#8217;d like to highlight on CiB, remember to be in touch!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, it&#8217;s Chris Unitt here. In what was rapidly becoming the worst-kept secret of modern times, Pete Ashton and I are taking on Created in Birmingham again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really good to be back.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the comments after <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/07/23/moving-forwards/">Adrienne&#8217;s post, &#8216;Moving forwards&#8217;</a>. We&#8217;ve taken some of those on board. There are likely to be a few tweaks and changes over the next few months &#8211; nothing too radical, but the site needs to evolve a bit if it&#8217;s to sustain itself and stay relevant.</p>
<p>On a related note, we&#8217;ve got a couple of new things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.facebook.com//pages/#/pages/Created-in-Birmingham/138414693814">Facebook Page</a></li>
<li>A forthcoming <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/about/newsletter/">weekly newsletter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please do sign up if you&#8217;re interested in either.</p>
<p>However, the most important thing is CiB isn&#8217;t  about whoever&#8217;s running it &#8211; it&#8217;s about all the fantastic and fascinating stuff happening in Birmingham. Which means I need to get on with writing some blog posts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I am extremely pleased to announce that the Created in Birmingham t-shirts and tote bags are now on sale! The items sport a fantastic design &#8211; a map of Birmingham&#8217;s wards <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/03/08/the-winner-of-the-cib-design-competition-is/" target="_blank">created by Kate Parry.</a> All profits made from the items will be donated to <a href="http://www.acorns.org.uk/" target="_blank">Acorns Children&#8217;s Hospice</a>, a charity based in Birmingham that proved popular with you, the readers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://cutoutshop.bigcartel.com/category/created-in-birmingham" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3570" title="cibt" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cibt.jpg" alt="cibt" width="600" height="363" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cibt.jpg 600w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cibt-300x181.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>The  items have been lovingly hand screenprinted by Kay Stanley at Cut Out Shop, in her WM based studio. She has used waterbased inks which don&#8217;t harm the environment printed onto <a href="http://www.earthpositiveonline.com/" target="_blank">EarthPostive</a> tees and tote bags.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://cutoutshop.bigcartel.com/product/cib-charity-t-shirt" target="_blank">The t-shirts cost £15.00</a> and <a href="http://cutoutshop.bigcartel.com/product/cib-charity-tote-bag" target="_blank">the totes cost £8.00</a>. We have printed a limited edition run of only 50 t-shirts and 50 tote bags, and each item is individually numbered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to take some swish pictures of the items being modeled, but have decided to let you do that for me! When you receive your tee or tote through the post, take a quick snap of you modeling it and pop it up on flickr, tagging it &#8216;CiBT&#8217;. Huge thanks to Kay Stanley and Kate Parry for all the help and support.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/01/19/charity-idea-help-needed-please/" target="_blank">set out an idea</a> for a CiB charity project involving a design competition resulting in the production of a limited edition CiB t-shirt which will raise money for a Birmingham based charity. Now, two weeks on, I have done a bit of research, taken on-board all of your suggestions and found lots of helpful people who would like to get involved.</p>
<p>We have decided to money raised will go to a popular choice for a Birmingham based charity: <a href="http://www.acorns.org.uk/" target="_blank">Acorns Children&#8217;s  Hospice.</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3047" title="ciblabel3" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ciblabel3.jpg" alt="ciblabel3" width="425" height="262" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ciblabel3.jpg 425w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ciblabel3-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p>This is the first call for submissions and here is how it will work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can submit a design entry to the competition, as long as you follow the specifications needed for printing.</li>
<li>From the entries 20 final designs will be chosen and made into 50 limited edition pin badge sets.</li>
<li>One final design will be chosen and will be made into 50 limited edition t-shirts and 50 limited edition canvas bags.</li>
<li>All items will be lovingly screenprinted by hand and sold online by <a href="http://cutoutshop.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Cut &#8211; Out</a>, a fantasic DIY print company based in the West Midlands. All items will be printed with eco friendly inks and on top quality <a href="http://www.earthpositiveonline.com/" target="_blank">Earth Positive</a> apparel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The brief:</strong></p>
<p>We want to make a t-shirt that people will really want to wear, so the brief is very loose. The emphasis here is celebrating creative talent in Birmingham and raising some money in the process. You could design something which reflects the creativity of the city, or just your own style, it&#8217;s up to you!</p>
<p><strong>Submission guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The design should work using one colour, if the image is a photograph it needs to be converted to half tone.</li>
<li>The design you submit needs to be 300 dpi (usual print quality).</li>
<li>The design should be no bigger than A3 in size.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deadline: Friday 6th March 5pm.</strong> Send your design as a PDF or JPG file to Createdinbirmingham[at]gmail.com, and hang on to your originals.</p>
