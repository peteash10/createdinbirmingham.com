<p>On 16 and 17 October 2010 I&#8217;m hosting <a href="http://smweekender-oct10.eventbrite.com/">a weekend session designed to help creative people take control of their online lives</a>. The course will be aimed at online beginners/intermediates and will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Mailing lists</li>
<li>Social media (YouTube, Flickr, Slideshare, Audioboo and others)</li>
<li>Social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)</li>
<li>How to boost your profile</li>
<li>How to work with others online</li>
<li>How to approach journalists and bloggers (and what to send them)</li>
</ul>
<p>Places are limited. Tickets cost £150 plus booking fee. It&#8217;ll be more than worth your while. <strong><a href="http://smweekender-oct10.eventbrite.com/">Book now</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also ONE £100 ticket for the first person who books. Be quick &#8211; once it&#8217;s gone, it&#8217;s gone. Wow, that went quickly.</p>
<p><span id="more-7066"></span></p>
<p><strong>Some context</strong></p>
<p>The Internet has changed how artists can do business. See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/08/15/business/SOAPBOX.html">this recent article in the NY Times</a> for examples of that. The problem is that, when it&#8217;s possible to do <em>anything</em>, it can be hard to know where to start. That&#8217;s where this course comes in.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll help you get set up with the solid foundations of an online presence. We&#8217;ll also show you how to make use of it but the overall takeaway from the course will be this:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you do <em>nothing else</em> online, at least have these basics in place</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s more we&#8217;ll do all of this using free tools and we&#8217;ll put you in control of using them.</p>
<p><strong>Why do <em>this</em> course?</strong></p>
<p>As a result of running Created in Birmingham I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of artists and creatives and the ways they portray themselves online. I&#8217;ve learnt a few lessons from doing my own projects and running my own business too.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s (almost) nothing I haven&#8217;t seen, I know what can reasonably be expected of a busy person and I know what works.</p>
<p><a href="http://smweekender-oct10.eventbrite.com/">Full information on the course and booking details are here.</a></p>
