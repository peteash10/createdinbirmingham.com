				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next Animation Forum West Midlands event, <a href="http://www.animationforumwm.co.uk/news-display.aspx?id=90">Grads On Walls</a>, will be at Concrete on 13 October and will showcase the work of the region&#8217;s recent graduates.</p>
<p>I really do recommend these.Â  Shorts On Walls and Ads On Walls were great, even for someone like me who never got past using the corners of school exercise books as flipbooks.Â  These screenings are just like a trip to the cinema.Â  Only free.Â  And they serve drinks.Â  The work screened is consistently excellent too.</p>
<p>Of course if you are an animator then it&#8217;s a good chance to meet like-minded souls.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to go down then RSVP (check the site) to let them know you&#8217;re going.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to submit work then read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Submissions for Grad&#8217;s on Walls can include short films, music videos, experimental and commercial pieces. The only requirement for submissions is that animator should either be currently based within the West Midlands, or have graduated from a University within the region. Good quality student work will also be considered for screenings.</p></blockquote>
<p>then go to the <a href="http://www.animationforumwm.co.uk/news-display.aspx?id=90">AFWM site</a> for details of where to send a DVD of your work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next event from <a href="http://www.animationforumwm.co.uk/">Animation Forum West Midlands</a> is at Concrete in the Jewellery Quarter on 11 August 2008.Â  Called &#8216;<a href="http://www.animationforumwm.co.uk/news-display.aspx?id=78">Ads On Walls</a>&#8216;, it&#8217;s an opportunity for local animators to get together for a natter, showcase their work and generally get to know each other a bit more (call it networking if you must).</p>
<blockquote><p>Many Forum members often don&#8217;t realise how many animation studios and companies there are dotted around the region, and part of the &#8216;big idea&#8217; behind <em>Ad&#8217;s  on Walls</em>, is to introduce animators to what&#8217;s actually going on, on their  doorstep.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Shorts On Walls event that AFWM ran a few months back was well worth going to (even for a non-animator like myself) and this one seems to be following a similar format.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to go along then entry is free but you&#8217;ll need to RSVP to david.luke.allen@bcu.ac.uk or call 0121 204 9886.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like your work to be screened at the event then submissions are open &#8211; get in touch on the above details to find out where to send a DVD of your work.</p>
