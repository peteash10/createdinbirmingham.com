				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capsule started a ball rolling the other week, <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/2010/01/28/engaging-regional-audiences-how-do-we-do-it/">talking about how to engage regional audiences</a>. There&#8217;s a good discussion in the comments that&#8217;s worth (re)visiting.</p>
<p>Dunc from <a href="http://www.theautumnstore.co.uk/">The Autumn Store</a> (and various indiepop bands, I&#8217;ve slightly lost track tbh) has followed this with <a href="http://aboutaboywhosjustlikeme.blogspot.com/2010/02/why-dont-people-come-to-my-gigs-some.html">&#8220;Why Don&#8217;t People Come To My Gigs&#8221;: Some thoughts on audience categorisation</a>. Which is very good and kinda in the vein of the guides to promoting gigs he wrote a while back (have a root through his site).</p>
<p>Following a couple of links, I stumbled across Scene Not Heard which seems to have started at the beginning of this year:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.scenenotheard.co.uk">Scene Not Heard</a> aims to be a  portal for artists and fans alike to the massive great plethora of  musical happenings going on in Birmingham</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://drownedinsound.com/community/boards/music/4229689">a discussion thread about Birmingham&#8217;s music scene</a> on Drowned in Sound, but I think they tend to come round fairly frequently.</p>
<p>Which all adds up to a community of music people in Birmingham all wanting to make stuff happen (standard caveats about &#8216;music&#8217; tending to refer to indie/rock only in these kinds of discussions).</p>
<p>One more thing to highlight in all of this is a line from Dunc&#8217;s post in which he refers to the original discussion on Capsule&#8217;s blog, the significance of which I leave to you to discern:</p>
<blockquote><p>it&#8217;s off the back of an event discussing the &#8216;music industry&#8217; which  always makes me feel like I shouldn&#8217;t be part of the conversation</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dunc from the Autumn Store has compiled a non-exhaustive list of 101 West Midlands bands. Non-exhaustive because he gave up at 101 and because he set himself two restrictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>There were two criteria to this, firstly, they must have a myspace page and secondly, they must have spent most of their musical lives inside the <a href="http://www.networkwestmidlands.co.uk/Maps/busMaps.html" target="_blank">West Midlands Bus Network</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The result is slightly reminiscent of the <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2008/10/gigbeth-2008-myspace-marathon.html">Myspace Marathons</a> BiNS&#8217; did for Gigbeth and Dunc&#8217;s patience in pulling together that many links to MySpace pages has to be applauded.</p>

Roger Shannon pays tribute to the late Isaac Hayes in an article most remarkable for the idea of a band consisting of Isaac Hayes, Huggy Bear and Taurean Blacque with Lovejoy as their manager.  Oh, scrap that &#8211; I just got to the bit where Roger auctioned Hayes&#8217; boxer shorts&#8230;</li>
