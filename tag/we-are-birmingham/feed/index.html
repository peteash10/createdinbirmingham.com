				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wearebham.com/2011/05/announcement-future-birmingham/">We Are Birmingham have announced that</a> they&#8217;ll:</p>
<blockquote><p>cease trading as a retail operation and are now investigating ways to move the organisation towards a new model, offering valuable exhibition space and meeting rooms at it’s city centre location, whilst still working to support the local creative community</p></blockquote>
<p>So it&#8217;s not closing yet, it&#8217;s just not going to be a shop anymore. No doubt there&#8217;ll be more to come on what the new model will look like but in the meantime I&#8217;d like to congratulate everyone involved for what they&#8217;ve managed to pull off over the past eight months and wish them all the best for the next phase.</p>

<p>Featuring new pieces and a selection of more familiar, reworked pieces, the exhibition will consist of detailed montages rendered across wooden panels and canvases.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspired  by inner-city sprawl, discarded objects, architectural foliage and  influenced by Avant Garde posters and decollage, the familiar and  mundane are transformed into unexpected environments. Many of the works  spread out like chaotic viruses and others dwell in a post-apocalyptic  world where dereliction and organic mass have fused.</p></blockquote>
