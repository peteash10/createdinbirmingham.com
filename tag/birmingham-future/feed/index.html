				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer brought with it <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/13/birmingham-degree-shows/">degree show time of year</a> and also <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/its-the-first-be-festival-soon/">the first Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> (which I&#8217;m pleased to see will be back again this year). Listings started coming out for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/the-hmv-institute/">the HMV Institute</a> too.</p>
<p>The days were getting longer, which was probably just as well for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/19/rhubarb-collision-hungry/">Rhubarb Rhubarb, who seemed to doing loads</a>. Birmingham presented its <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/city-of-culture-finger-crossing-time/">final bid for the City of Culture</a> and we crossed our fingers. Temper <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/30/cut-from-a-different-cloth/">filled the streets with fashion icons</a>. We looked at the trailer for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/24/soulboy-trailer/">Soulboy</a> and discovered <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/reuben-colley-fine-arts-blog/">the blog for Reuben Colley Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/arts-funding-cuts-in-the-west-midlands/">Arts Council announced a 0.5% cut</a> in funding to RFO&#8217;s. Boo. We found <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/15/synth-eastwood-in-birmingham/">some familiar faces</a> in Synth Eastwood&#8217;s video tomfoolery from the Flatpack Festival. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/14/treasured-a-secret-journey/">Treasured</a> at the MAC looked good.</p>
<p>Bright Space started looking for people to get involved in <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/11/platform-2/">Platform</a> and I asked &#8216;<a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/08/does-birmingham-future-interest-you/">Does Birmingham Future interest you?</a>&#8216; and got a fairly resounding &#8216;Um, who?&#8217;. Theatre folk came together and spoke easy, the newly opened Zellig hosted the Bass Festival&#8217;s <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/04/speakeasy/">Fight The Power exhibition</a> and there was talk of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/verbalise-and-visualise/">verbalising and visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>Creative Republic launched <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/creative-republics-invisible-city-project/">Invisible City</a> and Marketing Birmingham released <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/a-couple-of-videos/">a new promotional video for the city</a> that featured a host of creative talent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.birminghamfuture.co.uk">Birmingham Future</a> bills itself as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Birmingham’s leading membership organisation for young professionals  working in the professional, financial and creative services sectors</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris Brown is involved with them and <a href="http://chrisbrownpr.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/calling-all-creatives/">has a question or two</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things I’ve been tasked to look into is why there is a lack  of creatives at these events. Is it cost, type of events or simply a  lack of understanding to what <a href="http://www.birminghamfuture.co.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham  Future</a> is. Perhaps it is the speaker or even the lack of other  creatives attending</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that there are a few people who read this who would describe themselves as working in the creative service sector (and several more who would rather be beaten with a stick than referred to as &#8216;a creative&#8217;). Have you got any thoughts on this?</p>
