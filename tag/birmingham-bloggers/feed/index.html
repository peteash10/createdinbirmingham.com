				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.paradisecircus.com/social-media-surgeries/" target="_blank">The Birmingham Bloggers Group</a> will be hosting their third free social media surgery for voluntary and community groups next Wednesday, January 28th at BVSC 138 Digbeth, B5 6DR, (<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=B5+6DR+birmingham&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.476971,-1.891944&amp;spn=0.001601,0.003862&amp;t=h&amp;z=18" target="_blank">map</a>).  You can drop in anytime between 5.30pm to 7.00pm. Volunteers will be on hand to offer free advice to anyone who is curious to how tools like blogs, podcasts, video and social networks could help to their organisation, community group or charity. The surgery will be: No boring speeches or jargon just hot drink and some friendly advice.</p>

<p>I have a particular interest in how small organisations can use all this &#8216;internet stuff&#8221; to promote themselves so I will be going along for the first time to offer up my bit of  knowledge and heaps of enthusiasm to anyone who needs it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ll have to excuse some slightly hectic posting this week and next while I get my head round 300ish new RSS feeds and an inbox stuffed with interesting (and hopefully not yet out of date) emails.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also introduce myself properly later but for now, here&#8217;s a round-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">aCtiVe arts</a> is a steering group, made up of committed residents and local professionals, dedicated to providing quality arts experiences and opportunities for the Castle Vale community of North-East Birmingham&#8221;.  They have <a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">a blog</a> and you are advised to see what they&#8217;re doing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next <a href="http://www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk/">Drop Beats Not Bombs</a> runs from Friday 2 to Monday 5 May (the bank holiday) and tickets are available.  That&#8217;s at The Rainbow (and the warehouse and arches) in Digbeth.  There should be more info on their website but it was having bandwidth issues last I checked.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The people at the <a href="http://www.thepeopleshop.co.uk/">People</a> shop in Kings Heath are having a party with drinks and canapÃ©s at their store on Saturday 26th April from 10am until 5:30pm.  It&#8217;s in aid of Macmillan, there&#8217;s a raffle for a luxury goodie bag and visitors can have their photo taken by <a href="http://www.emilyquinton.com/">Emily Quinton</a>. Get all the info <a href="http://thepeopleshop.co.uk/index.php?main_page=fundraising">here</a>.Â  **UPDATE** It was a big success with Â£430 raised on the day.Â  More events will follow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simon has started a blog called <a href="http://birminghamcentral.blogspot.com/">Birmingham Central</a>.  He says he&#8217;s &#8220;been inspired by the recent blogging epidemic sweeping Birmingham and the value of a good blog to share news and information&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of bloggers, the next Birmingham Bloggers meet-up will be on Tuesday 29 April at Rooty Frooty in the Custard Factory.  <a href="http://www.podnosh.com/blog/2008/04/22/birminghambloggersmeet4/">Nick Booth</a> has more info but I refer you also to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=12243583846">Facebook event</a> and the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/495801/">Upcoming</a> page.</li>
</ul>
