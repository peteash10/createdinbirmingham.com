<p>I saw <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/mother-india-21st-century-remix">Mother India: 21st Century Remix</a> in 2008 and it was honestly one of the best things I saw that year. It&#8217;s been off on tour since but will be back in Birmingham on Sunday (11 April) to crown <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/mother-india-weekend">Mother India weekend</a> &#8211; a bunch of events happening at the Town Hall and Symphony Hall.</p>
<p>This version of Mother India is:</p>
<blockquote><p>A reinterpretation of the 1957 Indian cinema classic as a 45 minute silent movie with new musical score will be performed live by DJ Tigerstyle, drummer David Shaw and cellist Matt Constantine with Josh  Ford as visual editor.</p>
<p>MI21 is a compact, powerful and sensual take on Mehboob Khan’s Hindi masterpiece &#8211; a hugely important film in South Asian  cinema, known for its iconic imagery and powerful storyline: the common shorthand is  to reference it as India&#8217;s &#8216;Gone with the wind&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Definitely go and see it. Here &#8211; <a href="https://tickets.thsh.co.uk/Online/mapSelect.asp?BOset::WSadmissions::admission::performance_id=F12A6F77-8778-4AA7-A84C-A3FDBEAFBF02">here&#8217;s the link to get tickets</a>.</p>
<p>Other things happening as part of the weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fri 9 April <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/arun-ghosh-sextet">Arun Ghosh Sextet</a> (Symphony Hall foyer bars)</li>
<li>Fri 9 April &#8211; <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/pandit-shiv-kumar-sharma-mother-india-weekend-">Pandit  Shivkumar Sharma (Mother India Weekend)</a> (Town Hall)</li>
<li>Sat 10 April &#8211; <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/mid-day-mantra-">Mid-day Mantra &#8211;  Sanchita Pal</a> (Symphony Hall foyer bars)</li>
<li>Sat 10 April &#8211; <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/amaan-ayaan-ali-khan">Amaan &amp; Ayaan  Ali Khan (Mother India Weekend)</a> (Town Hall)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is in association with <a href="http://www.birminghamjazz.co.uk/">Birmingham Jazz</a>, the others with <a href="http://www.sampad.org.uk/">sampad</a> and, in some cases, <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/">The Drum</a>.</p>
<p>The Mid-day Mantra thing sounds quite good &#8211; a variant on the Rush Hour Blues series, I guess. That&#8217;ll be happening once a month from now on and will be a freebie.</p>

<p>Mother India weekend at <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/">Town Hall and Symphony Hall Birmingham</a> will be a journey through  the musical heritage of India over 9-11 April, taking in the mystic heights of  classical traditions via Anglo-Indian classical fusion to cutting-edge  contemporary Asian remixes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The weekend’s musical journey starts at the pinnacle of Mother India’s  classical tradition, with a rare UK recital by santoor maestro and  living legend Pandit Shivkumar Sharma.  Then we encounter a younger  generation of Indian musicians, Amaan and Ayaan Ali Khan. These gifted  sarod players come from a distinguished classical lineage, but here they  take the ancient classical tradition of Mother India on an East-West  cross-cultural journey in collaboration with young British cellist  Matthew Barley. Finally, we come right up-to-date in a cutting-edge  event when young British-Asian artist DJ Tigerstyle explores his  heritage and re-visions Mother India, a classic of Indian cinema, in  contemporary idiom.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best events I went to last year was Kala Phool&#8217;s Mother India: 21st Century Remix &#8211; a live re-scoring of the Bollywood classic that blew me away. I&#8217;ve wittered on about it <a href="http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/2008/08/mother-india-21st-century-remix/">on my blog</a>.</p>
<p>I was really pleased to hear that the musicians will be in the studio (in Birmingham) next week to record the soundtrack and <a href="http://www.kalaphool.com/">Kala Phool</a> are trying to put together a national tour for later in the year.</p>
<p>Kala Phool are after a film maker to make a kind of video &#8216;calling card&#8217; for this. However, the bad news is there&#8217;s no budget available for the work. I must say I don&#8217;t tend to like posting these sorts of requests but I&#8217;m making an exception in this case.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still interested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filming will happen on Fri/Sat 16-17 January at studios in Aston near The Drum</li>
<li>They need some short interviews with the people involved and some footage of the band in the studio</li>
<li>There&#8217;s plenty of footage from the live shows already</li>
<li>They&#8217;re looking for something like the video of <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=HY54PDPEvvc">The Bays and Heritage Orchestra at the Liverpool Phil</a></li>
<li>The finished piece will be needed by the end of January</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can help then email Indy Hunjan at <span class="HcCDpe"><a href="mailto:indy@kalaphool.com">indy@kalaphool.com</a> or call her on 07977 449052.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mother-india.jpg" rel="lightbox[1876]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1877" title="mother-india" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mother-india.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="353" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mother-india.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/mother-india-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>In a nutshell, a version of Mother India (seminal 1957 Bollywood flick) has been re-visualised and re-scored and will be officially launched at The Drum (who co-commissioned it) on 2 August at 7.30pm.</p>
<p>This looks pretty much essential and I&#8217;m gutted that I&#8217;m not going to be around to see it.Â  Instead, I&#8217;m going to torture myself by going through a few links.</p>
<p>This version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_India">Mother India</a> (or MI21 as they would have us call it) has been re-cut and remixed by Josh Ford, with the score re-interpreted by (ex-world champion) <a href="http://www.myspace.com/djtigerstyleuk">DJ Tigerstyle</a> accompanied by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mrthursday">Matt Constantine</a> (cello) and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/daveshawdrums ">David Shaw</a> (drums).Â  <a href="http://therenderghost.blogspot.com/2008/03/mother-india-21st-century-remix.html">The Renderghost</a> (great name) has been involved too.Â  The music sounds fantastic and you get get a sneak peak on the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/kalaphool">Kala Phool MySpace</a>.</p>
<p>The organisers assure us that, although it&#8217;ll appeal to a contemporary audience, it&#8217;ll stay true to the source material.Â  After the screening there&#8217;ll be a panel discussion to round things off.</p>
<p>This project has been co-commissioned by <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/ ">The Drum</a> and is launching in Birmingham (although it has been shown at Drop Beats Not Bombs) before touring nationally and, perhaps, internationally.</p>
<p>For more info, see the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/4055453/MI21-UKLaunch-eFlyer3">MI21 eflyer on Scribd</a> (you can zoom in if the text is too small).</p>
