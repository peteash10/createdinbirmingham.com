				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting one.Â  The Digbeth-based <a href="http://www.dynamicsarts.com/">Dynamics Arts</a> look to be overseeing the launch of a new community radio station that will be based in the <a href="http://www.custardfactory.com/">Custard Factory</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days but things are moving apace.Â  There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thestirrer.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2547&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=20">a bit of discussion over on The Stirrer&#8217;s forum</a> which will give you an idea of what&#8217;s going on but I met Paul Hadley from Dynamics Art and here are some bulletpoints I came away with (note, everything&#8217;s liable to change):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rhubarb Radio will pick up the keys to the unit in the Custard Factory (the one that&#8217;s currently a bridal shop) on 1 August</li>
<li>The station will start broadcasting using a makeshift studio in the unit at the front of the Custard Factory (on the left, opposite the reception area) as soon as Capsule have stopped using it for Supersonic (so mid-July)</li>
<li>The daytime audience will be creatives/students/etc</li>
<li>In the evening there will be specialist music shows, possibly patching in to events at the nearby Barfly, Factory and Rainbow</li>
<li>Advertising will be used to recoup overheads (including all licences needed) before being reinvested in the station</li>
<li>The area behind the studio will have a workshop for training sessions on digital film, music, video, etc using Photoshop, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro and so on.Â  Training will be accredited</li>
<li>A reference part for this project might be London&#8217;s <a href="http://www.resonancefm.com/">Resonance FM</a></li>
<li>The station will broadcast via the internet and probably via a <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/radio/ifi/rbl/rsls/">Restricted Service Licence</a> for a while</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no website yet &#8211; anyone who wants to help with that (again on a volunteer basis) is very welcome</li>
</ul>
<p>People who want to get involved (all on a voluntary basis) are welcome and there&#8217;s going to be a meeting at The Kitchen at the Custard Factory on Thurs 3 July at 6pm.Â  As Paul said on The Stirrer:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="postbody">We&#8217;re looking for many supporters to perform all sorts of roles&#8230;&#8230;. it&#8217;s not just about presenting, there&#8217;s the need for researchers, producers, trainers, admin support, management committee members, fundraisers, marketeers, pr, runners, technicians&#8230;&#8230;. the list goes on.</span></p></blockquote>
