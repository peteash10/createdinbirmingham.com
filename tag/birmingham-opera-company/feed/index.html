<p style="text-align: left;">Some of Birmingham&#8217;s most creative musicians and performers have come together for the &#8216;<a href="http://www.stockhausenbirmingham.co.uk/">Stockhausen Festival of Light</a>&#8216;, a celebration of the hugely influential electronic composer Karlheinz Stockhausen running from 19-21 August. With the backing of the Birmingham musical institutions of the University of Birmingham and the Birmingham Conservatoire, speakers from all around the world have been brought in to share their thoughts on the man. These talks will all lead up to big finale of the festival in the spectacle of the <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/">Birmingham Opera Company</a>&#8216;s performance of Stockenhausen&#8217;s opera &#8220;<a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=120">Mittwoch aus Licht</a>&#8221; that will be performed at Argyle Works.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This will be the world premiere of the opera, which has been previously labelled &#8220;unstageable&#8221;; and no wonder with this description: &#8220;string quartet performing in helicopters, electronic and acoustic music and a dancing camel&#8221;.  Unfortunately tickets for the performances are all sold out, BUT there is still hope!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to catch one of Birmingham&#8217;s best theatrical production companies doing something never seen fully on stage ever before, your only chance to see some of the 6 hour Opera will be a visit to the dress rehearsal on Tuesday 21 August as part of the Stockhausen festival, or head to the website the Space (<a href="http://thespace.org/" target="_blank">http://thespace.org/</a>) where <wbr>the Helicopter String Quartet is due to be broadcast.</wbr></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This just in:  The Big Screen in Victoria Square on Wed 22nd will be showing a live  satellite relay, so now you have no excuse to miss out.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As part of the festival will a performance at the MAC called &#8216;<a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/event/modified-stockhausen-feat-modified-toy-orchestra">Modified Stockhausen</a>&#8216; and will feature the Birmingham toy tamperers <a href="http://www.modifiedtoyorchestra.com/live.php">Modified Toy Orchestra</a>, tracing their influence back to Stockhausen through their playful electronic dismantlements.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In August, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/mar/13/stockhausen-opera-helicopters-birmingham">Birmingham Opera Company are going to stage Stockhausen&#8217;s five-hour epic Mittwoch aus Licht</a> (Wednesday from Light). Get this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Featuring real helicopters, two choirs, octophonic sound, numerous musicians, the Radio 1 DJ Nihal and requiring two separate performance halls, this will be the first time that all six parts of the opera have been staged together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, helicopters.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wednesday from Light easily ticks the once-in-a-lifetime criteria. Its finale, in which a string quartet perform in separate helicopters – so the whirring blades become part of the music – has been performed in isolation, but never as part of a complete performance. Vick said the DJ Nihal would be part of the helicopter segment in the role Stockhausen intended for himself, as a kind of moderator or commentator.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s not to love about that?</p>

<ul>
<li>A big guy with a phenomenal voice</li>
<li>A man in a Spiderman costume pushing a pram</li>
<li>A king who fashions himself after the dad out of The Royal Family</li>
<li>A cast of hundreds</li>
<li>A couple of brave guys in nothing but underwear (their choice apparently, and it&#8217;s not warm in that building)</li>
<li>A woman in killer heels with a bloody great big sword</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I always go on about BOC&#8217;s stuff but I don&#8217;t care &#8211; we&#8217;re lucky to have Graham Vick and co doing their thing in Birmingham. And if the &#8216;opera&#8217; tag puts you off then there&#8217;s all the more reason to see this one. <a href="http://birminghamopera.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=article&#038;id=75:tickets-going-fast&#038;catid=24:latest-news&#038;Itemid=31">Buy a ticket</a>. Go and see it. Do wrap up warm though, it&#8217;s a bit chilly in there.</p>
<p>If you want a sneaky peek at what they&#8217;ve done with Argyle Works this time, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYFN6N-T0P0">a video of us all clapping at the talented people</a> (well, I was waving my phone around like some sort of pillock, but you know what I mean).</p>

An odd thing to celebrate maybe, but <a title="Radar Magazine" href="http://www.theradarmagazine.co.uk/">Radar Magazine</a> used it as an opportunity to get a load of people to talk about the creative or cultural experience that had most impressed them over the past year.</p>
<p>I could&#8217;ve mentioned any number of things, but in the end I gave a nod to <a title="Birmingham Opera Company" href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/">Birmingham Opera Company</a>&#8216;s really-very-excellent-indeed Othello.</p>
<p>Others went for the <a title="4am Project - Birmingham Central Library" href="http://4amproject.org/2011/05/4am-project-april-2011-big-round-up/">4am Project at Birmingham Central Library</a>, <a href="http://www.brb.org.uk/">Birmingham Royal Ballet</a>, <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room">Lundahl &amp; Seitl at Fierce Festival</a>, <a title="Companis" href="http://www.companis.co.uk/">Companis</a>, <a title="Flatpack Festival" href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack Festival</a> and the <a href="http://www.cbso.co.uk/?page=concerts/viewConcert.html&amp;cid=2263&amp;m=12&amp;y=2010">Soweto Kinch Quartet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Radar-Magazine-A-Year-in-the-Life.png" rel="lightbox[10399]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10400" title="Radar Magazine - A Year in the Life" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Radar-Magazine-A-Year-in-the-Life.png" alt="Radar Magazine - A Year in the Life" width="550" height="337" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Radar-Magazine-A-Year-in-the-Life.png 550w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Radar-Magazine-A-Year-in-the-Life-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find a copy online &#8211; if there&#8217;s one floating about then please add a link in the comments.</p>
<p>Actually, speaking of CoC 2013, have the plans for the &#8220;<a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2009/11/03/festival-to-rival-edinburgh-planned-for-birmingham-in-2013-65233-25075791/">six-week Autumn Festival</a> which will have the significance of the Edinburgh festival and Paris Autumn Festival&#8221; been officially binned? I remember statements to the effect that it was going to happen regardless of whether Birmingham got the title or not, so strong were the arguments in favour of going ahead.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cybrum/status/108131156846837762">as has been pointed out</a>, there are quite a few festivals happening in October already.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Verdi: The Director’s Cut</strong> – Graham Vick prepares his production of  Verdi’s Aida for Bregenz Festival on the banks (and sometimes in!) Lake  Constance.

<blockquote><p><strong>Othello</strong> – a broadcast of the Birmingham Opera Company production in its  entirety starring Ronald Samm as Othello – the first time in a  professional production in the UK the role has been sung by a black  tenor. He is joined by Stephanie Corley as Desdemona and Keel Watson as  Iago and the Birmingham Opera Company Orchestra &amp; Chorus is  conducted by the distinguished UK conductor Stephen Barlow.</p></blockquote>
