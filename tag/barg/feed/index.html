				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just past the halfway point&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/27/cib-shop-new-beginnings/">Pete kicked off discussions</a> about how to follow on from the CiB Shop, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/27/the-little-chill/">The Little Chill looked like fun</a> and involved pretty much every promoter in town and <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/26/supersonic-2010/">Supersonic&#8217;s line-up</a> started coming together.</p>
<p>There was a lot of kerfuffle around <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/26/filming-turbulence/">the filming of Turbulence</a>, with lots of people getting involved in that too, and people seemed to be printing <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/25/poster-type-flyers/">big flyers for things</a>. I didn&#8217;t make it to <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/17/taste-of-birmingham-2010/">Taste of Birmingham</a> but people tell me it was pretty good. We also flagged up the work of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/12/sweaty-eskimo/">Sweaty Eskimo</a>.</p>
<p>BARG announced some <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/24/barg-taste-the-game/">fun and games at the Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/23/haji-noor-deen-at-the-hubb/">Haji Noor Deen visited The Hubb</a>, the Cut Out Shop folks made <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/06/the-diy-times/">The DIY Times</a> and I did a bit of a write-up from the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/08/the-first-be-festival/">BE Festival</a>. New Art Gallery Walsall <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/18/photos-at-nagw/">hosted the Taylor Wessing Photography Prize</a> for a while and the entirely excellent-looking <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/16/six-summer-saturdays/">Six Summer Saturdays</a> started.</p>
<p>There was news of cuts from the new government and I tried to wrap my head around the mess that was being made of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/20/about-these-leps/">sorting out a LEP</a> for Birmingham/West Midlands. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/13/the-flyeringpostering-issue/">The flyering/postering issue</a> got another run out too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/15/maybe-next-time/">Birmingham didn&#8217;t get the nod for City of Culture 2013</a>. Ah well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A while back I mentioned a strange meet up named <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/02/25/creative-networks-barg-meet-ups/" target="_blank">BARG</a> happening in the back of an old pub in Digbeth  These meetings were for anyone with a creative mind or just a childlike desire to play, and looked at how we can use mobile technology and social media stuff to play interesting games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3593" title="barg1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg" alt="barg1" width="597" height="113" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg 597w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1-300x56.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These games, much like the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emergentgame.org.uk%2F&amp;ei=lQoCSuiBLJO7jAfS6vWCBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCpUVPvs2vikW9RIOFM29RHKwKWg&amp;sig2=CHgA-fRtUiic7FJq5Q4C9A" target="_blank">Emergent Game</a> a few years ago prove that interactive play doesn&#8217;t have to be homed exclusively online or in the playground but can explore geographical areas in new ways, look at how we now communicate online and off, and give a chance for grown adults to play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Nicky doing good work in the city is Nicky Getgood who writes the blog <a href="http://digbeth.org/" target="_blank">Digbeth is Good</a>. She uses social media stuff like maps, videos and games within her blog which demand importance in the real world and sets the context firmly within the geographical area and a real community. The most interesting projects I have seen recently rely on this process of interweaving online and offline participation, such as <a href="http://4amproject.org/" target="_blank">4am Project</a> and other activities like Flickr meetups which happen in the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now spring has sprung the BARG group are taking games onto the streets of Birmingham, with the aim of  taking a fresh look at neglected parts of the city, and reclaiming them much like how skateboarders do. This Saturday between 2pm and about 7pm they will be hosting an afternoon of play and picnics on Curzon Street. For more information and maps etc go to <a href="http://www.npugh.co.uk/blog/w_i_d_e_o_p_e_n_s_p_a_c_e/" target="_blank">Nikki&#8217;s personal blog.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The first <a href="http://bargbarg.ning.com/events/barg-2" target="_blank">BARG</a> happened last month; games were played, cake was eaten and their was a whole lot of enthusing and exploring of social mechanisms. The Second BARG will feature: a look at rapid prototyping kits for game, discussion of a planned St Patrick&#8217;s day game, evolution of the <a href="http://www.emergentgame.org.uk" target="_blank">Emergent Game</a> and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you didn&#8217;t attend last month, you can still get in on the fun by turning up at <span id="eventLocation">The Lamp Tavern, Digbeth at 7pm.</span></p>

BARG is a noise, not an acronym apparently, also it is a &#8216;gathering of folks who&#8217;d like to discuss social games and playful things with an aim to either designing their own or just getting involved in playing some interesting stuff. Story-tellers welcome.&#8217;</li>
