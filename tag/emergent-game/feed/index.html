				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A while back I mentioned a strange meet up named <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/02/25/creative-networks-barg-meet-ups/" target="_blank">BARG</a> happening in the back of an old pub in Digbeth  These meetings were for anyone with a creative mind or just a childlike desire to play, and looked at how we can use mobile technology and social media stuff to play interesting games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3593" title="barg1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg" alt="barg1" width="597" height="113" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg 597w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1-300x56.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These games, much like the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emergentgame.org.uk%2F&amp;ei=lQoCSuiBLJO7jAfS6vWCBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCpUVPvs2vikW9RIOFM29RHKwKWg&amp;sig2=CHgA-fRtUiic7FJq5Q4C9A" target="_blank">Emergent Game</a> a few years ago prove that interactive play doesn&#8217;t have to be homed exclusively online or in the playground but can explore geographical areas in new ways, look at how we now communicate online and off, and give a chance for grown adults to play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Nicky doing good work in the city is Nicky Getgood who writes the blog <a href="http://digbeth.org/" target="_blank">Digbeth is Good</a>. She uses social media stuff like maps, videos and games within her blog which demand importance in the real world and sets the context firmly within the geographical area and a real community. The most interesting projects I have seen recently rely on this process of interweaving online and offline participation, such as <a href="http://4amproject.org/" target="_blank">4am Project</a> and other activities like Flickr meetups which happen in the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now spring has sprung the BARG group are taking games onto the streets of Birmingham, with the aim of  taking a fresh look at neglected parts of the city, and reclaiming them much like how skateboarders do. This Saturday between 2pm and about 7pm they will be hosting an afternoon of play and picnics on Curzon Street. For more information and maps etc go to <a href="http://www.npugh.co.uk/blog/w_i_d_e_o_p_e_n_s_p_a_c_e/" target="_blank">Nikki&#8217;s personal blog.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Thursday their are two very different creative meet-ups happening in the city:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3126" title="creative-networks" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creative-networls.jpg" alt="creative-networks" width="455" height="174" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creative-networls.jpg 949w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creative-networls-300x114.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Feb <a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com" target="_blank">Creative Networks</a> is the 3rd Creative Forum event with special guest speaker Ash Atalla, the writer and producer best known for producing The Office. The Creative Forum bit is usually a series of stands from organisations like Business Link and Screen WM on hand to offer advice. 5.30pm &#8211; 10.00pm</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3130" title="ning banner" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ningbanner_many-copy.jpg" alt="ning banner" width="522" height="99" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ningbanner_many-copy.jpg 522w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ningbanner_many-copy-300x56.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first <a href="http://bargbarg.ning.com/events/barg-2" target="_blank">BARG</a> happened last month; games were played, cake was eaten and their was a whole lot of enthusing and exploring of social mechanisms. The Second BARG will feature: a look at rapid prototyping kits for game, discussion of a planned St Patrick&#8217;s day game, evolution of the <a href="http://www.emergentgame.org.uk" target="_blank">Emergent Game</a> and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you didn&#8217;t attend last month, you can still get in on the fun by turning up at <span id="eventLocation">The Lamp Tavern, Digbeth at 7pm.</span></p>

<p>In case you&#8217;ve not been following it, it&#8217;s an &#8216;alternate reality game&#8217; (although I prefer their description of &#8216;a framework for exploring your surroundings&#8217;) and is part of the <a href="http://www.newgenerationarts.co.uk/">New Generation Arts Festival</a>.</p>
<p>Explaining what The Game involves is a little tricky but its main component is playfulness, which is hopefully enough to get you interested.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still plenty of time to take part though and even a couple of workshops to help you on the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://emergentgame.org.uk/sapiens/introductory_sessions/">Workshop 1</a> is at Rooty&#8217;s in the Custard Factory tonight (2 June).  Drop in any time between 4.30pm and 7pm.</li>
<li><a href="http://emergentgame.org.uk/sapiens/introductory_sessions/">Workshop 2</a> will be at BCU&#8217;s Dept of Fine Art on Margaret Street (just behind the BM&amp;AG) between 2pm and 4pm on Friday 6 June.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;ll be a sackful of toys and assorted items/materials for customising your new Luden.  You can also get involved in devising the street games that will be played later in the month.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an existing player then don&#8217;t bring your avatar, whatever you do.</p>
<p>If none of this makes the slightest bit of sense then all will be revealed on the <a href="http://emergentgame.org.uk/">Emergent Game</a> website.  Well, some will be revealed.</p>
