<p>At <a href="http://www.thebench504.com" target="_blank">The Bench 504</a>, owner Rob&#8217;s pursuit of quality graffiti, and the experience of travelling to paint, has led him to create a thriving business providing an exhibition space for a varied range of illustrators. It&#8217;s also enabled him to be involved in a range of projects, as well as protecting local graffiti spaces and introducing youngsters to the skill.</p>
<p>Now based in a <a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk" target="_blank">Custard Factory</a> Unit, Rob saw a gap in the market and put his savings into opening his own shop selling paints. Progressing from a few years based at a shared shop in Quinton, The Bench 504 now sits overlooking the pond at the Custard Factory, and has a colourful floor to ceiling selection of thousands of paints, which sell Europe-wide from the Birmingham location.</p>
<p>Graffiti artists take time to plan, practicing and sketching, often taking a sketch to the wall. Colour counts as part of the preparation. Getting good takes a lot of practice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1.jpg" rel="lightbox[17467]"><img class="size-full wp-image-17482 aligncenter" alt="Thebench504 exhibition weblarge" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1.jpg" width="467" height="640" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1.jpg 467w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></a></p>
<p>There are a steady stream of customers, as well as those coming to look at the latest exhibition. A customer arrives asking Rob for an order simply by naming the colour  &#8211; &#8220;I have learnt all the fruits in German and Spanish&#8221; Rob laughs, going on to explain that the main brands come from around Europe, and the range he stocks now includes seven brands as the demand grows. The paints stocked at The Bench 504 are highly specialised, some are even artisan &#8211; including Spanish brand MTM (Montana) being run by artists who couldn&#8217;t get the quality they wanted, so started mixing their own.</p>
<p>The exhibition space in the shop features a different illustrator every four weeks. Until Wednesday 23rd April the exhibition is &#8216;Off the Rails&#8217; by mixed media artist Lucy Danielle, a Birmingham-based freelance illustrator who studied at Birmingham City University.</p>
<p>Rob was also involved in the future of quality graffiti, ensuring it could continue in the local area. There was a park, Bournbrook Rec, in Selly Oak from the 1980s which councillors were happy to have as a legal space for artists, until mid 2000s when that changed. The local graffiti community gathered a focussed campaign and turned around the council&#8217;s opinion of the art, and of the artists, to overturn the decision and re-open the park.</p>
<p>The park is now back in full and frequent use with a high quality of work. The artists know what they can or can&#8217;t paint over, as the unwritten rules and etiquette of sharing the graffiti space are self regulated, ensuring they have somewhere to develop the skills and talent to create impressive work.</p>
<p>Rob&#8217;s enthusiasm for the art continues, and when the sun is shining the paints fly off the shelves.</p>

<p>If you trawl through the prehistoric timeline in search of the unique &#8216;<a title="Jurassic Panda" href="http://www.jurassicpanda.com/" target="_blank">Jurassic Panda</a>&#8216;, you&#8217;ll discover a very current Gemma Hotchkiss. Birmingham-based artist Gemma created the project a couple of years after completing her degree in Printed Textile Design at Birmingham Institute of Art &amp; Design (BIAD) Gosta Green.</p>
<p>Always encouraged to showcase her sense of humour in her work, the business fist existed as a Uni project entitled &#8216;Dinosaur Panda&#8217;. The name she says, came to her quite randomly;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d always loved dinosaurs and had carried a stuffed panda toy around everywhere with me as a child. It had been pushed in buggies, force-fed food, dressed-up, operated on &#8211; you name it! And that’s really where the idea came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>She likens the dinosaurs in her designs to young, boisterous children who are best friends with cuddly Panda bears that &#8220;just go along with it all&#8221;. And why not?</p>
<p>Post-graduation, Gemma &#8211; like most &#8211; spent some time in the creative wilderness, wondering what it was that really inspired her and how she could turn this into something real. After she&#8217;d hand-drawn a variety of designs she felt confident that she&#8217;d cracked it and finally figured out how to visualise her sense of humour.</p>
<p>And it was from there, following a quick name-change, that &#8216;Jurassic Panda&#8217; &#8211; the business &#8211; came to life.</p>
<p><span id="more-16565"></span></p>
<p>Gemma searched around and found a couple of UK-based companies that produced printed merchandise in low volumes, and began by creating a few pocket mirrors and postcards.</p>
<p>The next step was all about experimenting, as Gemma explains;</p>
<p>&#8220;I set up an <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/jurassicpanda" target="_blank">Etsy account</a> and had a play around until I got the hang of it all. I then created a website myself using Tumblr, a custom domain name and a bit of very basic HTML.&#8221;</p>
<p>She then took to Twitter &#8211; @<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Jurassic%20Panda&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">JurassicPanda</a> &#8211; and it was there where she discovered an entire community of creatives that were just like her, trying to make a living out of doing what they loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to have discovered some fantastic creative people through the &#8216;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Jurassic%20Panda&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">Jurassic Panda</a>&#8216; Twitter account. They are extremely generous with their time and knowledge, and I&#8217;ve learned a great deal from them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>With everything set up and ready to go, Gemma&#8217;s shop was quiet at first. But as with any Etsy start-up, it took a lot of patience and time spent social networking before the sales started to come in. From there, Gemma started applying to sell her work at craft fairs.</p>
<p><a title="Jurassic Panda Shop" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/jurassicpanda" target="_blank">Visit her shop here</a> and all Created in Birmingham readers can enjoy 1<strong>0% OFF until the 31st January 2014</strong>.

<p>You can also see Jurassic Panda in all its scaly, furry and humourous glory this weekend at <a href="http://www.theflapper.co.uk/gigs/the-flappers-christmas-bazaar" target="_blank">Small Business Saturday, at The Flapper</a> pub. It&#8217;s a FREE event and runs from 12pm until 6pm.</p>
<p>Small Business Saturday is an American concept that exists to encourage everyone to shop only with local or small independent retailers, for one day of the year. It has become such a success in the US that it&#8217;s been bought over to the UK.</p>
<p>Gemma has worked in partnership with The Flapper pub to help curate what will actually be 2-day Christmas Bazaar event on Saturday 7th and Sunday 8th December, with Small Business Saturday of course taking-up Saturday&#8217;s programme.</p>
<p>The event will showcase talented, local creatives all running their own businesses and feature the unique work of jewellery makers, makeup artists, hair stylists, illustrators and craft makers. There will also be acoustic musicians playing in the bar.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t make it this weekend, don&#8217;t worry. You can catch Gemma at her final event pre-Christmas, on Saturday 14th December in Digbeth at the <a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/whats-on/digmas-coming/" target="_blank">Custard Factory&#8217;s big Christmas event, &#8216;Digmas&#8217;</a>, from 10am until 6pm.</p>
<p>Gemma will also begin 2014 with a creative bang. On Sunday 2nd February she has been invited to be a guest speaker at the <a title="Spring Fair" href="http://www.springfair.com/" target="_blank">NEC&#8217;s Spring Fair</a>. She will be giving a talk on how to develop an online concession through a third party website.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve a penchant for pandas and a real taste for mash-ups, show your support for extremely talented local artist Gemma Hotchkiss and her beautifully bizarre business, <a href="http://www.jurassicpanda.com/" target="_blank">Jurassic Panda</a>.</p>

<p>Fused magazine, as part of <a title="Eyecandy" href="http://www.eyecandyfestival.co.uk/" target="_blank">Eyecandy Festival</a>, are helping out the <a title="Oxjam Brum" href="http://www.oxjambrum.org.uk" target="_blank">Oxjam charity</a> this year by calling for submissions for a 12&#215;12 visual interpretation of your favourite record sleeve.</p>
<div>They will be giving artists a blank 12&#8243; record sleeve  for them to &#8216;re-imagine&#8217; a new cover for their favourite album by a Midlands artist/ or maybe write/design their favourite song lyrics which they will auction off for Oxjam at the end of the festival. Here is a little background about Oxjam and why Fused Magazine are getting involved;</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">OxjamBrum operates with zero budget; and so we ask that all artists involved kindly donate their services for free, enabling us to make sure every single penny raised goes to Oxfam. This year’s Takeover Festival is raising funds for, and awareness of Oxfam’s GROW campaign. The OxjamBrum Takeover Festival is a major one-day multi-venue celebration of the best of Birmingham’s independent music scene, curated and delivered by a team of dedicated volunteers who know and love the city.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is a great cause to get involved with and we hope to see lots of submissions at the auction. Oxjam will take place on Saturday 13th October along with lots of other events in Birmingham that day! </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">To get your sleeve, email dave@fusedmagazine.com or <a title="Fused Magazine" href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/2012/09/13/12x12-submissions-wanted/" target="_blank">click here</a> to find out more.</span></div>
