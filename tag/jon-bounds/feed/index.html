Worth bearing in mind &#8211; &#8220;I’ve worked out over a few years that “private view” means two things: if a show is big and important it means “no entry unless you’re invited”, if a show is small or not that well known it means “please come, there’ll be free wine and nibbles”. It’s developed as art-jargon for some reason, and people who know know and those that don’t don’t. But it does put off people who might otherwise have liked to have attended—and the smaller shows could do with that, in fact they want it.&#8221; Now to decide if your show is big and important or if it&#8217;s smaller</li>

<p>The first of what might become a regular thing, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/12/08/knowing-me-knowing-you/">Knowing Me, Knowing You</a> was fun last week. As part of Capsule&#8217;s longest birthday party&#8230; ever, we got together and invited a bunch of interesting people along to introduce themselves and say (for the sake of getting a conversation going) what they might do if they were to get their hands on VIVID for a little while.</p>
<p>The kind participants were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dandavies23.com/">Dan Davies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/falsedog">Ben Waddington</a></li>
<li>Fin &amp; Ken from a new (currently  nameless) housing co-op</li>
<li>Sara  from <a href="http://www.needlesandhooks.co.uk/">Needles and Hooks</a></li>
<li>Mark Murphy from <a href="http://surely.uk.com/">Surely?</a></li>
<li>Stuart and Ben from <a href="http://www.firstfoldrecords.com">First Fold Records</a> (who&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.firstfoldrecords.com/?p=453">blogged about it</a>)</li>
<li>Sarah from <a href="http://heatlight.blogspot.com/">Heat and Light</a></li>
<li>James Yarker from <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> (well, I read out his submission)</li>
<li>One of Eagle and Feather from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/OOOOKIPPLEOOO">Kipple</a></li>
<li><a href="http://benjavens.blogspot.com/">Ben Javens</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All ably compered by <a href="http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/">Jon Bounds</a> with half-time entertainment provided by <a href="http://pindec.co.uk/">Charlie Pinder</a>&#8216;s cake orchestra.</p>
<p>Truth be told, we weren&#8217;t sure what people would come back with or what sort of direction the evening might take. As it turned out, ideas included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social spaces</li>
<li>Turning the place into a massive ball pool/packing it floor to ceiling with jelly</li>
<li>Setting up a swapshop</li>
<li>Using it as a place for realising unfinished ideas</li>
<li>Creating an edgeless, white room and projecting images through hung pieces of perspex</li>
<li>Kipple Live</li>
<li>Artist talks</li>
</ul>
<p>And some other things that escape me just at the moment. To be honest, the suggestions themselves weren&#8217;t the most crucial part of the evening. The point was really to get people out, meeting each other and sharing thoughts and ideas. As far as that goes I think the evening was a success.</p>
<p>Capsule have <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/?p=895">written up the event here</a> with lots of lovely photos. Thanks to them, to everyone who took part and to those who came along to watch.</p>
