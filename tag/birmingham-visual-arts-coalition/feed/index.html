				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was agonising about how much I can say about this without giving too much away (given police intervention with recent Birmingham flash mobs) but I&#8217;ve just noticed all the info&#8217;s now up on the <a href="http://www.b-vac.com/2008/08/flash-mob-art/">B-VAC blog</a> anyway, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Saturday 16 August, members of the <a href="http://www.b-vac.com/">Birmingham Visual Arts Coalition</a> will be exhibiting pieces of their art to an unsuspecting public:</p>
<blockquote><p>These â€˜exhibitionsâ€™ will last for a very short period of time (ie. a matter of minutes) and if the public choose to view or ignore it they do so at their own discretion.Â  They will appear to be completely random and the members of B-VAC will not make themselves known to the audience until the point at which the exhibition begins.</p></blockquote>
<p>This will happen between 1-2pm and the list of venues (in no particular order) is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oozells Square &#8211; along the diagonal drain</li>
<li>outside Bullring &#8211; by the Bull</li>
<li>Centenary Square &#8211; by the fountain</li>
<li>somewhere in the St. Phillipâ€™s grounds</li>
<li>Victoria Square &#8211; around the Andrew Gormley</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.b-vac.com/">B-VAC website</a> for more info.</p>

<p>From what I can find, Birmingham Visual Arts Coalition have <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=E5yXSRMZYC_2fKVKpRPApy5Q_3d_3d">described themselves</a> as &#8220;innovators in contemporary art&#8221;.  <a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=3397">D&#8217;log reported</a> about a call for submissions back in Feb and seems to have received a lot more info at the time</p>
<blockquote><p>Initially working towards common deadlines for exhibitions B-VAC would hope to establish itself as an organisation that produced original and varied work through its member artists, but ultimately aiming to create their own sustainable artistsâ€™ hub and community within the region</p></blockquote>
<p>For those that can&#8217;t see the pic, the first B-VAC exhibition takes place this weekend (4pm Friday 6 June to 4pm Sunday 8 June) at The Works Gallery, 3rd Floor, Jubilee Works, 130 Pershore Road, Digbeth B5 6ND.</p>
<p>Any more info about B-VAC &#8211; a website, Facebook group, anything &#8211; would be gratefully received in the comments.</p>
<p>Flyer is from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hellocatfood/2481237782/">hellocatfood&#8217;s Flickr</a> &#8211; his work will be at the exhibition.</p>
