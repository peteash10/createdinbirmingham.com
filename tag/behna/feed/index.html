				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have realised, we haven&#8217;t been posting as much recently, leaving it to our guest contributors to fill the pages on CiB.

<p><strong>Behna (Sisters)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This unique and intimate theatre production by <a href="http://www.kalitheatre.co.uk/">Kali Theatre</a> will be performed in the kitchens of Punjabi households across the Black Country from 22 March to 15 April.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the day before a wedding, Ladies&#8217; Sangeet Night, in a Punjabi household. The bride is having her henna done and the guests are busy eating, singing and dancing. But in the kitchen, sibling jealousy simmers alongside the samosas.  Fast-paced, funny and moving, Behna takes a look through the keyhole of a family house to reveal the secrets and lies of two generations of sisters.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>One, Nineteen</strong></p>
<p>One, Nineteen from local ‘Archers’ writer, Tim Stimpson, is on at <a href="http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk/">The Old Joint Stock Theatre</a> on 18 &amp; 19 March.</p>
<blockquote><p>19th January: Freak storms bring devastating floods to the English coast, but before the rescue effort arrives, the media are already in town spinning their story. A play about the power of the news, the strength of the government, the question of climate change, and of course, and the search for Sam, Jack and little Chloe&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>After premiering in London, it was given a 4 star review from Time Out, so it&#8217;s probably worth a watch.</p>
