				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I must admit I slept on this one a bit.Â  With the Custard Factory-based Rhubarb Radio conducting their development out in public (on the <a href="http://rhubarbradio.wordpress.com/">Rhubarb Radio blog</a>) and edging closer to launch, I almost missed <a href="http://southbirminghamcommunityradio.co.uk">South Birmingham Community Radio</a> which launched on 9 August.</p>
<p>Broadcasting from Druids Heath on 87.7FM and online (although that wasn&#8217;t working when I tried it) the station is staffed by a mix of volunteers and experienced pros with Chris Gee (ex-Kerrang), Pat de Whalley (ex-BBC WM) and Ranking Roger all presenting shows.</p>
<p>Things seem a little sketchy at the moment &#8211; there&#8217;s no programme schedule or any indication of whether they&#8217;ll major on music, talk or both -Â  but then they&#8217;ve only been going a few days.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a mission statement of sorts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made by the People For The People</li>
<li>With news and views from the people of South Birmingham</li>
<li>Sports reports from local matches</li>
<li>Music and song from local talent</li>
<li>Information on local services and agencies</li>
<li>Information from local business</li>
<li>Plus gossip competitions and a chance to get involved</li>
</ul>
<p>The station has funding from the <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=100298&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=14808">Community Network South West</a> scheme that aims to support communities affected by the closure of MG Rover, so there&#8217;s some emphasis on the training and experience that the station can give to people looking to boost their CVs.</p>
<p>There are bound to be loads of ways to get involved with the station if you&#8217;d like to help out.Â  I imagine the best way to do that would be to call Peni Whelan, station manager, on 07828 797 467 or use the <a href="http://southbirminghamcommunityradio.co.uk/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;Itemid=3">contact form</a>.</p>
