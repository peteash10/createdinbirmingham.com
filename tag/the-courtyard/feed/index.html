				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thebiggive.org.uk/">The Big Give</a> helps to boost the amount of money given to other charities. They have double-your-donation challenges once in a while and one of those kicks off today (supported by <a href="http://www.artsandbusiness.org.uk/">Arts &amp; Business</a>).</p>
<p>Around Birmingham there are a couple of projects to back:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://new.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/8520">The MAC are looking for just over £15m</a> to cover building costs</li>
<li><a href="http://new.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/7393">Birmingham Royal Ballet are after £800,000</a> for their staging of Cinderella</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, neither of these are very clear. Cinderella opened a few days back and is on until 12 December. The MAC seem to be after twice as much as The Big Give made as a whole last year, although you can&#8217;t fault the ambition.</p>
<p>Just to widen the net a little to the rest of the West Mids, <a href="http://new.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/8347">Ironbridge</a>, <a href="http://new.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/8325">The Courtyard </a>and <a href="http://new.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/8682">Pentabus</a> all have appeals. Of those with a national focus, <a href="http://new.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/8317">Dance Umbrella</a> and <a href="http://new.thebiggive.org.uk/projects/view/8193">The Campaign for Drawing</a> are looking for donations.</p>
<p>UPDATE</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/page/3767/The+Big+Give+Challenge">The MAC&#8217;s own website</a> says they&#8217;re after £6k, not £15m.</p>
