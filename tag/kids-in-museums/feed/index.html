<div>Kids in Museums came about when in 2003 Guardian writer Dea Birkett&#8217;s young son was thrown out of the Royal Academy for being too noisy, Kids in Museums now leads in promoting family-friendly policies and attitudes throughout Britain.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The charity have put together a Museums and Galleries <a href="http://www.kidsinmuseums.org.uk/our-manifesto/" target="_blank">Manifesto</a>, which is really interesting reading for anyone who works with families in the arts. They also give out the annual Guardian&#8217;s Family Friendly Museum Award, which their website says has been an incredibly successful way of encouraging and guiding museums and galleries across the country to make family visits engaging and enjoyable.</div>

<div></div>

I should imagine that the volunteer post can be done remotely and would be a good opportunity to work with a well connected, worthwhile London based charity. Candidates should be familiar with Flickr and,  preferably, other appropriate social media sites. Interested? Please email: getintouch[at]kidsinmuseums.org.uk<a href="mailto:getintouch@kidsinmuseums.org.uk" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><img src="file:///C:/Users/Katie/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-2.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
