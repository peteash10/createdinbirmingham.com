				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d post my response to an email I received from someone the other day. The emailer said (and these are a couple of extracts):</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently looking for creative projects to get involved with in the Birmingham area, specifically film or media based projects. I have lots of transferable skills through studying film on my course and I am looking for possible work experience (unpaid) in TV, film or any kind of production, as a runner, film grip and/or any position where the skills I have may come in useful.</p>
<p>My biggest focus is finding opportunities, getting out there and getting involved in anything I can, from possible collaborations to arts events, workshops, anything to keep me busy and anything that allows me to be creative and continues the type of work I was doing on my course.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of anything specific but gave a few starting places. I operate on the assumption that CiB readers know much more than I do, so if anyone can add anything then please do in the comments. My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any specific opportunities at the moment. It&#8217;s a bit of a funny time for that kind of thing at the moment, what with Screen WM (who used to put on events and so on) closing down a few months back and Creative England (the body taking their place) only just getting up and running. In the meantime it might be worth looking at <a href="http://www.bsin.co.uk/">http://www.bsin.co.uk/</a> and seeing what they&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p>Also, have a look at these events, get yourself along and see who you meet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.producersforum.org.uk/">http://www.producersforum.org.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/">http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamsmc.com/">http://www.birminghamsmc.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.helloculture.net/">http://www.helloculture.net/</a> (this is on tomorrow)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Maybe see what courses are happening at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/ ">http://www.macarts.co.uk/</a> or <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/">http://light-house.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some pics of a couple of posters/fold-out leaflet things.</p>
<p>I was sent this one which publicises <a href="http://www.grand-union.org.uk/">Grand Union</a>&#8216;s thing with Justin Carter:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Grand Union - Justin Carter by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/4821985248/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4821985248_32a17ccc50.jpg" alt="Grand Union - Justin Carter" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Rhubarb Rhubarb fold-out leaflet by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/4821989496/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4821989496_c3c9780466.jpg" alt="Rhubarb Rhubarb fold-out leaflet" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
