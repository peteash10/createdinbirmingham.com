<p>Computer games and individual bands are outside the traditional remit of CiB but this is a bit too cool to not warrant a mention.  According to their <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/music/showcases/band/62048.html">bio on the SXSW website</a>, local band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deluka">Deluka</a> have somehow managed to get their song &#8216;Sleep Is Impossible&#8217; featured on the next installment of the Grand Theft Auto series.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t spend their days complaining about their parents and/or hiding in their bedrooms, the Grand Theft Auto franchise has sold 70 million units to date &#8211; making it as popular as Tetris but much more controverisal.  GTA 4 is due out imminently and likely to be one of the biggest-selling computer games released this year.</p>
<p>So congrats to Deluka.  You can check out their obligatory <a href="http://http//www.myspace.com/deluka">MySpace page</a> and you can also go see them at The Barfly on 29 April supporting another rather decent local band, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/envyandothersins">Envy &amp; Other Sins</a>. I understand the gig will be reviewed and photographed by the guys at <a href="http://www.brumlive.com">Birmingham Live!</a> too.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://antoniogould.com/">Antonio</a> for the heads up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ll have to excuse some slightly hectic posting this week and next while I get my head round 300ish new RSS feeds and an inbox stuffed with interesting (and hopefully not yet out of date) emails.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also introduce myself properly later but for now, here&#8217;s a round-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">aCtiVe arts</a> is a steering group, made up of committed residents and local professionals, dedicated to providing quality arts experiences and opportunities for the Castle Vale community of North-East Birmingham&#8221;.  They have <a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">a blog</a> and you are advised to see what they&#8217;re doing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next <a href="http://www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk/">Drop Beats Not Bombs</a> runs from Friday 2 to Monday 5 May (the bank holiday) and tickets are available.  That&#8217;s at The Rainbow (and the warehouse and arches) in Digbeth.  There should be more info on their website but it was having bandwidth issues last I checked.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The people at the <a href="http://www.thepeopleshop.co.uk/">People</a> shop in Kings Heath are having a party with drinks and canapÃ©s at their store on Saturday 26th April from 10am until 5:30pm.  It&#8217;s in aid of Macmillan, there&#8217;s a raffle for a luxury goodie bag and visitors can have their photo taken by <a href="http://www.emilyquinton.com/">Emily Quinton</a>. Get all the info <a href="http://thepeopleshop.co.uk/index.php?main_page=fundraising">here</a>.Â  **UPDATE** It was a big success with Â£430 raised on the day.Â  More events will follow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simon has started a blog called <a href="http://birminghamcentral.blogspot.com/">Birmingham Central</a>.  He says he&#8217;s &#8220;been inspired by the recent blogging epidemic sweeping Birmingham and the value of a good blog to share news and information&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of bloggers, the next Birmingham Bloggers meet-up will be on Tuesday 29 April at Rooty Frooty in the Custard Factory.  <a href="http://www.podnosh.com/blog/2008/04/22/birminghambloggersmeet4/">Nick Booth</a> has more info but I refer you also to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=12243583846">Facebook event</a> and the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/495801/">Upcoming</a> page.</li>

<blockquote><p>Whether or not you actually make short films, Shorts on Walls is a great chance for animators to meet and network after work with other freelancers, animation companies and professionals over a mid-week beverage.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s free to attend but please let them know if you&#8217;ll be going down.  There are contact details and more info on the <a href="http://www.animationforumwm.co.uk/news-display.aspx?id=52">Animation Forum West Midlands website</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, props to AFWM for showing how this web promotion lark should be done &#8211; the news page of their site has an RSS feed and features a map of the venue. There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4594019797">Facebook group</a> (with a list of participating animators/studios) to join as well as a newly-minted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/group/afwm">YouTube group</a>.<a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/shorts-on-walls.jpg" rel="lightbox[1619]"><br />
