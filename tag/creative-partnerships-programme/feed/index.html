				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the closure of the Creative Partnerships Programme, <a title="Bright Space" href="http://www.brightspace.org.uk/">Bright Space</a> announced that they would be closing. Today&#8217;s their last day.</p>
<p>This from <a title="Stan's Cafe" href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1832">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s sad because Brightspace were behind a huge number of inspirational projects that took artists into schools to work creatively with students and teachers. Now, despite a great report from OFSTED setting out the great value of these projects, the plug as been pulled, the axe has fallen, the bubble burst, the goose cooked, the turkey plucked, the swan sung and the full stopped.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d lost track of what&#8217;s happening with <a title="Creative England" href="http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/">Creative England</a> &#8211; I thought it was going to be based on a partnership of all the screen agencies <a href="http://www.rewiredpr.com/news/entry/screen_wm_brings_curtain_down_as_creative_england_takes_on_support_role/">but here&#8217;s a press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday 30th September 2011, regional screen agency Screen WM will bring the curtain down on nine years of support for the screen media industries in the West Midlands and welcome Creative England as the new umbrella body for the creative sector.</p>
<p>The closure of <a title="Screen WM" href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Screen WM</a> follows the coalition government’s decision to replace the <a title="UK Film Council" href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank">UK Film Council’s</a> support for film-making, which core-funded the regional screen agencies, with funding through the British Film Institute.</p></blockquote>
<p>All the best to the folks working at these organisations who are moving on.</p>
<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m predicting a few more posts like this over the next few months.</p>
