<p>On 24 September &#8211; 1 October, <a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/">Friction Arts</a> are holding <a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/inside-out-festival/">Inside Out Festival</a>. With artists, installations and performances all hosted at <a href="http://www.edgearts.com/">The Edge</a>, the festival will also showcase performances, installations and interventions across Digbeth.</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea behind this mini-fest is to continue to connect the communities  around our HQ – The Edge, through a shared experience of contemporary  art – in and around the streets of Digbeth.</p>
<p>There’ll be a series of art trails around the area, taking in works  specially made for the festival, but also the street art and built  environment of this very special district.</p></blockquote>
<p>The programme so far has events running across the opening weekend, with a launch party on 24 September in association with Sonic Asylum, featuring live music, installations and artwork. Other events will include art trails, live art and an artist&#8217;s brunch.</p>
<p>For more information on currently listed events, plus updates and information on volunteering, take a look at <a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/inside-out-festival/">their website</a>.</p>

<p>Just a quick round up of everything going on this weekend, there&#8217;s a lot and we wouldn&#8217;t want you to forget and miss out on anything!</p>
<p><strong>Cum Clubbing</strong> &#8211; Hosted by <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>,  this art party does not look like something to be missed (although it&#8217;s happening now, so get down quick). From 8pm &#8211;  late, VIVID&#8217;s project space will be taken over by live music, DJs and  visual artists who&#8217;ll conspire to create an excitingly strange evening  of camp disco. Tickets are £5.</p>
<p>To  save time I&#8217;m going to be both lazy and efficient, and link you to  everyone else who&#8217;s been talking about this. Take a look at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2010/09/cum-clubbing-at-vivid-this-saturday-10th-september/">Digbeth is Good</a>, <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/cum-clubbing/">More Canals than Venice</a>, <a href="http://brianduffyhasabigbrain.com/post/1003304250/cum-clubbing-for-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an">brianduffyhasabigbrain</a>, and <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2010/08/cum-clubbing%E2%80%9Cfor-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an-art.html">Birmingham: It&#8217;s Not Shit</a>.</p>

<ul>

<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/"><strong>Artsfest</strong></a> &#8211; As <a href="../2010/09/07/artsfest-2010-programme-now-online/">already mentioned</a>,  the weekend of free arts events kicks off this evening and will  continue to entertain through to Sunday night.

&#8220;Audiences Central, with arts consultant Kerry Endsor, is looking to develop and deliver a high-profile, public-facing, arts project that will encourage and inspire young people in the West Midlands to engage with the arts and culture&#8221;.

A couple of the Audiences Central peeps have started their own blogs recently, with this one from Fiona likely to be the most, um, quirky. She has/had a secret obsession &#8211; rating the city&#8217;s (and likely other cities&#8217;) toilets. So far pubs and restaurants feature highly</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamjazz.co.uk/wordpress/?p=115">Birmingham Jazz News &#8211; Birmingham Jazz gigs in Guardian’s top gigs of 2008!</a><br />
Congrats to Mary and co for gaining &#8220;recognition from respected Guardian Jazz critic John Fordham on the Dave Liebman tour and the Django Bates StoRMChaser project amongst others as highlights of the year&#8221;</li>

Antonio Roberts went to &#8220;the first Make and Do Party over at The Edge, which was hosted by Friction Arts. There were about 20 artists present and there was a strong emphasis on just having fun creating art!&#8221;. He has a quick write-up and some pics</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just had an email from a journalist writing an article on art in Birmingham.Â  She says:</p>
<blockquote><p>While I will be looking at galleries such as RBSA and Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery I would also like to look at something less conventional such as street art and something with a more independent edge</p></blockquote>
<p>The first few things that sprung to mind (thinking mainly of galleries) were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/">Ikon Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eastsideprojects.org/">Eastside Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/the-edge/">The Edge</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.urbanartbar.com/">Urban Art Bar</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?sid=a4d3b6d6c1fba222e69567a817fce395&amp;refurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fs.php%3Finit%3Dq%26q%3Dgallery%2Bof%2Bowls%26ref%3Dts%26sid%3Da4d3b6d6c1fba222e69567a817fce395&amp;eid=48773196528">Gallery of Owls</a> (although I&#8217;ve not visited and am struggling to find out much about this place)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.purplegallery.com/">Purple Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hedz.ltd.uk/">Hedz</a> (for street art stuff)</li>
</ul>
<p>What have I missed?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween might not be my bag but at least it&#8217;s an excuse to put some interesting events on.</p>
<p>Aside from the <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/258/here_and_now_and_the_future_do/">Ikon Eastside closing party</a> there are a fair number of Halloween-themed things going on.Â  These are they (all happening on Friday 31 October, except the last two):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-events/w-events-find_event.htm">The National Trust are putting on events in the back to back buildings</a> (50-54 Inge Street/55â€“63 Hurst Street, Birmingham).Â  From <span id="ctl00_cphPage_rpEvents_ctl02_lblDates">11.30am &#8211; 4pm they&#8217;ve got some nice events for the kiddies, then from 7pm to 9.30pm they&#8217;re </span>&#8220;offering visitors a unique opportunity to linger for a while in our shadow-laden rooms, and silently reflect on the atmosphere of the back houses lit by candles, fires and oil lamps&#8221;</li>
<li>The Town Hall are showing <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/evening-organ-concert--halloween-movie-special" target="_blank">Nosferatu</a> with an organ accompaniment by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Ogden">Nigel Ogden</a></li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.light-house.co.uk/cinema.shtml#drac">Light House are showing Dracula</a>, the Hammer version with Christopher Lee</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/events/detail/24/local_shorts_film_club/">Local Shorts Film Club</a> are running a Halloween special at the Library Theatre</li>
<li>Vivid are showing <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">a slowed-down version of Psycho</a> that will last a full 24 hours.Â  It starts at 9pm on Friday 31st and ends at 9pm the next day.Â  Entry is free</li>
<li>At the <a href="http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk/rte.asp?id=93">Old Joint Stock Theatre</a>, &#8220;Gemini present an evening of ghostly tales around the history of the Old Joint Stock followed by readings from a Medium&#8221;.Â  The night&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk/rte.asp?id=93" target="_blank">Ghostly Histories</a> and perhaps the scariest part is that the blurb mentions &#8220;clairvoyants with solid reputations&#8221;</li>
<li>And on 1 November the Outer Edge&#8217;s next event at The Edge features &#8220;some obscure 3D horror and live horror sound effects from DJ FreakBeat&#8221;. Email <a href="mailto:outersight@live.com" target="_blank">outersight@live.com</a> or text 07887 956297 for info.</li>
<li>Also on 1 November, <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/event/release-the-batsatp-halloween-party">Capsule/ATP are putting on a Halloween show</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://westmidlandsblog.metro.co.uk/2008/10/by-david-baldwi.html">West Mids Life blog</a> for a leg up compiling this.Â  Is there anything good I&#8217;ve missed?</p>
