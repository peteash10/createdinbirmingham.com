				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzimbra">Aaron Wright</a> is something of a CiB alumnus having worked in the CiB Shop a year ago. He&#8217;s currently at the <a title="Live Art Development Agency" href="http://www.thisisliveart.co.uk/">Live Art Development Agency</a> in London and having a whale of a time from what I can gather.</p>
<p>Anyway, he emailed me to say there&#8217;s a couple of shows of particular note that are on in Birmingham in the next week or so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/event/shams-reykjavik">SHAMS: Reykjavik</a></p>
<p>This is at the MAC from today until Saturday. Aaron saw it in London the other week and says:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was really great &#8211; innovative immersive theatre done with real style which was unusually matched with great content &#8211; one man starting a new life in Iceland. It&#8217;s only for 25 audience members at a time and you get to wear a nice boiler suit</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=213">nOSTalgie: a cabaret</a></p>
<p>This is on Saturday at the CBSO Centre. The blurb says:</p>
<blockquote><p>BCMG presents an evening of political songs and new vocal settings, under the brilliant direction of Dominic Muldowney, former Head of Music at the National Theatre</p>
<p>Buy a drink, take a seat and be transported by our cabaret singers, Mary Carewe and Richard Morris, between 1930s Germany and contemporary Britain, during an evening of entertaining delights from both eras</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As threatened previously, I did  pop over to Ikon Eastside on Friday lunchtime. The current installation is by <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/339/ryoji_ikeda/">Ryoji Ikeda and is called <em>data.tron</em></a>, part of:</p>
<blockquote><p>his exploration of the infinity of data between 0 and 1, an abstraction of reality that challenges our perception of the codes present in everyday life</p></blockquote>
<p>It was quite nice and sunny on Friday afternoon, so stepping off Fazeley Street and walking straight into a pitch black space was a little disconcerting. Especially with no-one else around, the air filled with a high-pitched whine and clicking with the large wall at the far end taken up by a projection of streaming data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg" rel="lightbox[3984]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3985" title="Ryoji Ikeda" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg" alt="Ryoji Ikeda" width="450" height="300" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg 450w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>For a second it all felt a little too Poltergeist/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28film%29">Ring</a>-esque &#8211; I half expected Sadako to start crawling towards me. That didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>What looked like white noise from a distance turned out to be precisely determined; calculated data with it&#8217;s own, very particular, order (albeit one I couldn&#8217;t make out &#8211; but I&#8217;m happy to accept it&#8217;s there). Interesting, then.</p>
<p><em>data.tron</em> will be at Ikon Eastside until 8 November, while on 24 November there&#8217;ll be an audio-visual concert &#8211; <em><a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/348/datamatics_ver20/">datamatics [ver 2.0]</a></em> &#8211; by Ryoji Ikeda at the CBSO Centre, hosted by <a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/">BCMG</a>.</p>
<p>The work will also form the backdrop of <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/352/onoff/">Ikon Eastside&#8217;s closing party</a> on 12 November:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dress code is black and white, lights and atmosphere will be suitably monochrome, music and bands organised in collaboration with <a href="http://wearecolour.com/">Colour</a></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw the <a href="http://www.theheritageorchestra.com/">The Heritage Orchestra</a> at the Town Hall (one of their rather good <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/page/contact-us/press-office/resonance-events-present-the-heritage-orchestra-orchestra-performing-the-music-of-amon-tobin/">resonance events</a>) last month and they were great, so I was chuffed to hear about Birmingham Jazz&#8217;s plans for celebrating <a href="http://www.stansulzmann.co.uk/">Stan Sulzmann</a>&#8216;s birthday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stan Sulzmann has had a long relationship with Birmingham Jazz and is a Honorary Fellow at Birmingham Conservatoire.  So when Stan mentioned that he will be 60 this November, plans were immediately put in place to mark the event in Birmingham with a concert with a small version of The Heritage Orchestra (THO) and with arrangements of Stanâ€™s material by both Jules Buckley and Stan himself.</p>
<p>Stan will be playing with THOâ€™s 13-piece string section plus an extended rhythm section with piano, bass, drums, guitar and percussion.  There will also be new material written for the occasion by Stan himself and by THO members Tom Richards and Sam Bullard</p></blockquote>
<p>Woo-hoo! It&#8217;s on Sat 29 Nov at the CBSO Centre and <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/birmingham-jazz-season---stan-sulzmanns-60th-birth">tickets are available NOW</a>!</p>
<p>Info about Stan Sulzmann&#8217;s 60th Birthday Celebration is here along with all the other stuff Birmingham Jazz have got on this month (ooh, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/porticoquartet">Portico Quartet</a> on the 28th).</p>
