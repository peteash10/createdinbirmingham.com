				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning I attended a meeting about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bigscreens/">BBC Big Screen &#8216;Live Sites&#8217;</a>. The idea was that we&#8217;d have an opportunity to discuss with <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/">Arts Council</a> and the gathered digital, media and cultural organisations<strong> how to use Birmingham&#8217;s Big Screen</strong> – currently situated in Victoria Square – in the lead up to the <a href="http://www.london2012.com/">2012 Olympic Games</a>.</p>
<p>The main thrust of conversation was around how the screen can be used to <strong>engage people passing by</strong> as well as using it as a <strong>focal point for streaming live events or supporting live performances.</strong></p>
<p>The first point to note is that the screen won&#8217;t simply be used as a big telly. As well as being able to screen video content, the screens are <strong>able to be used interactively </strong>using custom software and mounted cameras. This interactive content has included games such as cricket and quirkier ideas such as mapping animated masks onto the faces of passers by. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7042266&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7042266&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7042266">Hand from Above</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/chrisoshea">Chris O&#8217;Shea</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>As well as for use locally, content for the screens can be <strong>relayed around the other Live Sites in other areas of the country</strong> and can even be used for <strong>competitive interactive games and events between cities</strong>. Several ideas came out of the discussion included:</p>
<ul>
<li>highlighting local cultural events with interactive performances</li>
<li>creating interactive games to be played nationally and internationally</li>
<li>and making innovative film content to showcase</li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular note is the focus on dance in this region through the Arts Council&#8217;s <a href="http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/cultural-olympiad/">Cultural Olympiad</a> programme, predominantly the <a href="http://westmidlandsdance.com/peopledancing/">People Dancing</a> strand of activities. This was an area in which creative projects using the screens would be welcomed, and although <strong>no direct funding is available from the Live Sites programme</strong>, ideas that used them and linked with Cultural Olympiad aims would be of interest.</p>
<p>Other points made included the upcoming dates of note, such as the Olympic torch relays in the region and the possibilities of events occuring during the Cultural Olympiad&#8217;s Open Weekend on 22-24 July this year, and how local organisations can get involved and contribute to the events.</p>
<p>So, in general, the big screen will be used for more than just BBC News 24. Let&#8217;s hope that our Live Site produces some especially creative content and showcases some of the region&#8217;s cultural highlights.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to see it used it for?</strong></p>
