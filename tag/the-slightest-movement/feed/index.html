				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Call for Participants: The slightest movement, Fierce &amp; Quarantine</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.qtine.com">Quarantine</a>, in partnership with <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a>, are hosting a project entitled <a href="http://www.qtine.com/future/">The Slightest Movement</a>, bringing together groups of strangers to create a temporary community which openly debates difference, exploring tolerance and &#8216;otherness&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The task is repeated every day for a week.  Each day the event is  re-invented according to what happened the day before.  A small group  grows into a large one, gathering more and more strangers into a  temporary &#8211; perhaps uneasy &#8211; community.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slightest movement will take place 20-25 September in West Bromwich, and are inviting a core group of 15 people, both artists and non-artists, irrespective of background and experience to join this project. If you fancy getting involved, apply using the application via their website <a href="http://www.qtine.com/">www.qtine.com</a> by 3 September.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.brilliantlybirmingham.com/">Brilliantly Birmingham</a> festival is taking place  27 November 2010 – 9 January 2011, and is set to visit a variety of venues across the city, including the Flux exhibition of contemporary jewellery design at the <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A dynamic and ambitious exhibition of  new and emerging designer makers will promote challenging and diverse  new work, create a marketplace and contribute to the city as a visitor  attraction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flux is currently open to submissions from emerging designer makers based in the UK, who are no more than five years out of graduation. There&#8217;s no exhibition fee, but submissions have a £20 admin fee.</p>
