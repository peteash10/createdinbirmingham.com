				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was only saying to someone the other day that things had gone quiet at <a href="http://www.eastsideprojects.org/">Eastside Projects</a>.Â  The new artist space/gallery was slated to open (much) earlier in the year but seemed beset with delays.</p>
<p>No matter, because the opening party has been announced for Friday 26 September.</p>
<p>The first exhibition will be &#8216;This is the Gallery and the Gallery is Many Things&#8217; which will run until 11 November.Â  Over that time:</p>
<blockquote><p>the exhibition and gallery space will evolve from a highly constructed â€˜emptyâ€™ space to a layered and complex gathering of artworks, events and processes in various stages of convergence and divergence</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks like there&#8217;s going to be some talks by various artists too, the first being by <a href="http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/peter_fend">Peter Fend</a> at 4pm on 27 September.</p>
<p>Head to <a href="http://fusedmagazine.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/news-from-eastside-projects/">Fused for more details</a>.</p>
