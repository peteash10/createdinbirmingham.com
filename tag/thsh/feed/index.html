				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Birmingham a city where it is easy to collaborate with others?</p>
<p>I arrived in Birmingham in the summer of 2006, tasked with preparing  <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">Town Hall</a> for its anticipated re-opening, due to happen 18 months later  at the end of 2007. Although I had lived in the Midlands during my  school years, I didn’t really know Birmingham, and so had no idea how it  would feel to live and work in the City, despite the reassurances from a  few friendly faces I knew prior to my arrival.</p>
<p>Since then, I have worked closely with my colleague Paul Keene (Director  of Programming for THSH) to build new relationships with artists,  producers, promoters, other arts organisations, and civic and community  groups.  The most refreshing aspect of working in Birmingham has been  experiencing just how easy it is to meet people and “do business”.   Despite the huge amount of creative work taking place here, I quickly  found that everyone knows everyone, and really there’s no excuse not to  be working together and sharing ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/page/town-hall-birmingham/town-hall-image-gallery/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9509" title="Town Hall" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall-.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="263" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall-.jpg 712w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall--300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></a><br />
Our approach has always been to get out of Town Hall and to try and see  as many other things as possible, both to support the work of others,  but also to get a real understanding of how <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">THSH</a> fits into the creative  network of the City.  When your day job is overseeing a hall which  presents 300 different events a year, it’s important to remember to get  off the daily hamster wheel and make the time to meet with colleagues  from other arts organisations, as that tends to be how the interesting  new ideas and projects begin to take shape.</p>
<p>This week, Town Hall have hosted <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a> and <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/home/">Flatpack</a> in two exciting events  (<a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/mirror-mirror-the-irrepressibles">The Irrepressibles</a>, and <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/digging-for-gold">Digging For Gold</a>), and we are very proud to be  involved as partners in both festivals. The Irrepressibles show came  about because Laura from Fierce and I were both at a previous  Irrepressibles show in St Martin’s Church as part of last year’s <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/">SHOUT  Queer Festival</a>, and we were both blown away by what we heard. A couple  of quick discussions later, and a chat with Jamie from the  Irrepressibles, and we had agreed to jointly work together to bring the  group back to Birmingham for Fierce. With Flatpack, we have always kept  in touch with Ian and Pip, and following their big <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/2009/festival/event/curzonora">Curzonora</a> project two  years ago, we were keen to work with them to bring another Flatpack  project to Town Hall. By taking our successful existing silent film with  organ accompaniment format, and adapting it to include improvised piano  and some shorter films, we have been able to add to Flatpack’s focus  this year on archivist Iris Barry.</p>
<p>We are also preparing for our major <a href="http://www.symphonyhall.co.uk/page/contact-us/press-office/stravinsky-s-rite-of-spring-3d/">Rite of Spring 3D project</a>, taking  place on April 21st, and performed by the <a href="http://www.cbso.co.uk/">CBSO</a> with dancer Julia Mach  and artistic director Klaus Obermaier. We have made the financial  commitment to ensure that this extraordinary project is presented in  Birmingham, but as always, we want to work with our partners to ensure  that all the potential audiences get to hear about it, and we don’t  serve Birmingham audiences best by just doing that by ourselves.</p>
<p>That approach to the marketing strategy for the Rite of Spring project  runs through all of our work at THSH – we will always work with partners  wherever we can, whether it is us guaranteeing the fees and costs for a  project, or through more straightforward marketing and  cross-promotional relationships.  For example, if we are promoting The  Dhol Foundation in concert at Town Hall, we will work with <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/">The Drum</a>, <a href="http://www.sampad.org.uk/"> sampad</a>, <a href="http://punch-records.co.uk/">Punch</a>, <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/music-service">Birmingham Music Service</a> and independent promoters to  ensure that we utilise as many avenues as possible to spread the word on  the show, and to help develop an audience for the artists. We are also  talking to the <a href="http://www.birminghamjazz.co.uk/">Birmingham Jazz</a> team on a weekly basis, sharing ideas for  future projects, and working together to promote performances such as  the recent Uri Caine/Mahler concert, as part of the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/the-birmingham-mahler-cycle">Birmingham Mahler  Cycle</a>.</p>
<p>On a national basis, we’re working with promoters and festivals  including <a href="http://www.serious.org.uk/">Serious</a>, who collaborate with us to ensure that artists  including Mariza, Staff Benda Bilili and Salif Keita are performing in  Birmingham as part of their limited UK tour plans. Serious and other  promoters who represent touring artists are keen to include Birmingham,  but this will only happen if an organisation like THSH is prepared to  invest and commit to the artists, as these concerts rarely stand up on a  purely commercial arrangement.</p>
<p>So, back to my original question – is Birmingham a city where it is easy  to collaborate with others?  Five years on, we can look back over a  very broad range of collaborations, some of which were for one-off  occasions, and some which have since evolved into an ongoing  relationship. I believe that collaboration is definitely one of the  things that Birmingham does best, and we should be proud of what we can  achieve by working together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a classical musician, I have often found that contemporary music is met with extreme unnecessary prejudice from most audiences, and even from the musicians themselves. However, we have come a long way since Arnold Schoenberg and his band of merry Serialist pranksters.</p>
<p>We are lucky to live in city so diverse that there is music and art of all types so readily available to us. In the music scene, some artists aren&#8217;t just available, they are begging for audiences to experience their music. I have sourced some excellent music that is being performed in Birmingham in the next month, alone. This is just a tiny snapshot into the world of music and performance that is not achieving quite the audience members that it rightly deserves.</p>
<p>With the news of the cuts happening in the next few years in Birmingham, it is now that we should be celebrating what we, as artists, have to offer. The best way, I feel, to do this, is to see everything. Go to concerts and experience what has been provided to us, show the people in charge of money in this city what, we, as music fans need.</p>
<p><strong>Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical, dance, technology</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the the CBSO&#8217;s (City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra) biggest projects of the 2010/2011 is it&#8217;s performance of Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Rite of Spring</em>. A formidable and excellent piece in it&#8217;s own right, the creators at the CBSO and Symphony Hall have fused together music, dance and technology :</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience an astonishing interplay between reality and fantasy as dancer Julia Mach’s extraordinary live performance interacts, through the magic of digital wizardry, with real-time, computer generated stereoscopic projections, translated into a virtual reality space with the aid of 3D spectacles for the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; THSH</p>
<p>The 30-minutes piece is preceded by Varese&#8217;s <em>Tuning Up</em> and Ligeti&#8217;s <em>Lontano</em> for large orchestra, a distant and warm piece which plays with with the make-up of unconventional diatonic harmony.</p>
<p>For more info and for the special Rite of Spring micro-site, please visit <a href="http://riteofspring3d.thsh.co.uk/">http://riteofspring3d.thsh.co.uk</a></p>
<p><strong>Birmingham Contemporary Music Group &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>The BCMG is the city&#8217;s orchestra dedicated entirely to the performance of contemporary and new music. Made up of players from the CBSO, the flexible organisation has grown in the one of the world&#8217;s most fore-thinking ensembles of new music. They play regular concerts at the CBSO Centre on Berkley Street, B1, as well as touring all over the city.</p>
<p>The percussion players are performing what promises to be an excellent concert of Varese and Xenakis on the 25th March at Yardley Old Church as well as this Sunday (13th March).</p>
<p>Oliver Knussen conducts his own memorial work <em>Requiem &#8211; Songs for Sue</em> as well as pieces by Morton Feldman and Harrison Birtwistle</p>
<p><strong>Steve Reich and Thomas Ades. &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>This week, Friday 11th March, Symphony Hall have also included another excellent performance of contemporary. The London Sinfonietta, one of the world&#8217;s leading orchestra for contemporary classical music are visiting Birmingham, performing Steve<br />
Reich&#8217;s <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em>, complete with 4 grand pianos and 5 marimbas. The minimalist style of Steve Reich is used in many sources of media, films, adverts and television, purely for the fact it is accessible to both musician and audience alike. Conductor Thomas Ades? starts the concert with his own In Seven Days, a collaborative project with filmmaker Tal Rosner and is based on the Creation.</p>
<p>Tickets start from £10 (or £5 on the day for U25s)</p>
<p><strong>The Irrepressibles: Mirror Mirror<em> &#8211; contemporary pop, performance art, collaboration, crossover</em></strong></p>
<p>Another gig at the heart of Birmingham, the Town Hall, <em>The Irrepressibles</em> are a 10-piece orchestra committed to stretching the boundaries of conventional performance. Lead by singer, Jamie McDermot, they perform hearty indie music with a set up of orchestral musicians as accompaniment.</p>
<p>This show is in conjunction with Fierce Festival and is at Town Hall, 22nd March, £15</p>
<p><strong>SOUNDkitchen &#8211; <em>contemporary, sound, experimental, collaboration</em></strong></p>
<p>SOUNDkitchen is a new group made up of music graduates from the University of Birmingham. Their “STONEsoup” concert at the MAC was met with rave reviews and are following up with a collaborative event with Balkanic Eruption, promoters of Klezmer and Balkan music within the city. Playing at the Hare and Hounds, B14, the concert focuses on expanding sound using technology and live instruments, it will be followed by a live laptop performance from Garfield Benjamin.</p>

<p><strong>Birmingham Conservatoire &#8211; <em>classical contemporary, premieres, fusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Like the Uni of Birmingham, the Conservatoire has one of the most developed composition departments in the country. The students are exceptionally talented and lucky for us the concerts are generally very cheap and on a regular basis. This month as well as a student showcase of new music (held on the 18th March and conducted by the great Edwin Roxburgh) we see the <em>Frontiers</em> department of Conservatoire play host to world-renowned electronic violinist, Barbara Luneberg. This young talent has worked with some of the world&#8217;s best contemporary composers. On the 14th March, Luneberg is to perform works written for her by young composers from all over Europe, this will also include a premiere of work by VT of the Conservatoire, Ed Bennett.</p>
