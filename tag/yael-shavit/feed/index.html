				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before we get to the interview, you need to know that PolarBear will be at the Garrick Theatre in Lichfield on 9 July &#8211; details after the interview.Â  Anyway, I&#8217;ll leave Frankie to get on with things&#8230;</p>
<p>When Frankie Met Poet/MC <a href="http://www.myspace.com/polarbearspoken">PolarBear</a>â€¦ or didnâ€™t! Due to being immensely popular an arranged meeting never materialized and instead the two conversed via email:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Frankie: So firstly, the new show &#8220;If I cover my nose you can&#8217;t see me&#8221; is described as a story about what happens to what we used to want.Â  So what does that mean and what should audiences expect?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/polarbear-cover-my-nose.jpg" rel="lightbox[1820]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1823 alignright" style="float: right;" title="polarbear-cover-my-nose" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/polarbear-cover-my-nose.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="348" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/polarbear-cover-my-nose.jpg 230w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/polarbear-cover-my-nose-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></a></p>
<p>PolarBear: The story is about the idea that what we plan as kids often gets completely lost. Some part of us is always a kid and that somewhere those plans stay with us, itâ€™s just that grown up stuff covers over them.</p>
<p>Audiences can expect a story about a 10 year-old boy and a man of 28 as their lives intertwine and they both make decisions that will completely change their lives.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You&#8217;re starting off in London too. When and where will Birmingham audiences get to see the show?</span></p>
<p>Yeah gonna do a couple nights at Purcell Room, Southbank centre which is exciting with <a href="http://www.goonism.com/ ">Goonism</a> doing live art work and a music event after. Will be doing some one offs here and there and come to Birmingham REP in October this year, I think around the 17th/18th. Goonism will be there too so be good to show the finished article to brummies.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">On your Myspace page you call it &#8216;The best thing I&#8217;ve ever performed&#8217; and praise the team who you worked with, including director Yael Shavit. A lot of people who write and perform their own pieces also choose to direct it. What made you get a separate director involved and how was the experience of working with her?</span></p>
<p>I honestly believe that you canâ€™t direct yourself. Not properly. Just like you canâ€™t edit yourself. Not properly. Itâ€™s important to get someone elseâ€™s eyes involved. With Yael (Shavit) it was a matter of me liking her work and her appreciation of a story and realistic characters and trusting that she could get the best out of me.</p>
<p>Working with her has honestly been the best thing ever for my performance. We understand each other and trust each other, which feels like it is the basis for a good creative relationship.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The production also features music by <a href="http://www.foyvance.com/">Foy Vance</a>. I&#8217;ve always had him down as the acoustic/folk type. How did that collaboration come about?</span></p>
<p>I met Foy a couple of years ago on a TV thing and we became friends. I like what he does and he likes what I do and we started working together when we got chance and I asked him to create some sounds very early on in the process.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moving onto <a href="http://www.myspace.com/afrobearhop">Afrobear</a>&#8230; is that a musical partnership? Is the recorded music on your myspace page part of Afrobear or is that part of an individual project?</span></p>
<p>Afrobear is a long-standing relationship between myself and my friend Len who produces under the moniker <a href="http://www.myspace.com/afrosaxon">Afrosaxon</a>. Basically he is my favourite beat maker ever and I get to write rhymes and make tunes with him as AFROBEAR. Itâ€™s our version of what hip-hop should be today.</p>
<p>There is, at any one time, maybe one or a couple AFROBEAR tracks on my myspace and these will be credited clearly. Other stuff is work with other producers or just me on my own.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why have you called the album &#8216;Not Shit&#8217;? Are you expecting backlash!? What can we expect from it?</span></p>
<p>Not too fussed about backlash to tell you the truth. â€˜Not Shitâ€™ is a term we use to describe stuff we like, a lot. Itâ€™s a Brummie trait of not being that impressed by much so the norm is â€˜shitâ€™ and good stuff is â€˜Not Shitâ€™.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You&#8217;ve called Brighton your favourite place to perform. Why?</span></p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to perform in lots of places in the last three years and had some great experiences and to date, no terrible ones. Some ones Iâ€™ve not particularly enjoyed but none that have gone really badly. With Brighton, I performed at a place called the Komedia and the crowd were the warmest most respectful audience to every single performer. It was pretty inspiring and Iâ€™m quite a cynical person really. Amazing.</p>
<p>Good people down there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/m_1b54d50a8287db7b1adcbbffbcd9e60a.jpg" rel="lightbox[1820]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1824 alignright" style="float: right;" title="polarbear" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/m_1b54d50a8287db7b1adcbbffbcd9e60a.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="255" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do you think it is important to remain in Birmingham or are you planning to move to London? Is Brum part of your &#8216;creative process.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>Iâ€™m actually based in London now due to my family. My girlfriend works in theatre and her work meant she couldnâ€™t leave London and we had a little boy and being free-lance I could be based anywhere so I went down. Iâ€™m up in Brum at least two days a week for workshop work and so it feels like I live in two places, but itâ€™s working. Itâ€™s important to me to be from Birmingham.</p>
<p>It will always be home. The people I grew up with here and know now are the inspiration for everything I have written so far.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And finally&#8230; after Colin Murray played &#8216;Jessica&#8217; on his show you must have got a lot more interest. What was the inspiration for &#8216;Jessica&#8217; and is Jessica real?</span></p>
<p>Nice one Colin Murray. I mean itâ€™s nice to reach more peopleâ€™s ears I guess and I didnâ€™t even know it was gonna happen. Heâ€™s played it a few times now which is nuts but good exposure.</p>
<p>Jessica is based on reality and was inspired by a few experiences in my life as well as things that havenâ€™t happened yet.</p>
<p>Jessica is very real. But maybe I changed her name.</p>
<p>PolarBear will be appearing at the Garrick Theatre at 10pm on Wed 9 July.Â  Tickets are <a href="http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/TicketPurchase?agency=LICHFIELD&amp;organ_val=22268&amp;schedule=list&amp;event_val=0799">only Â£6.50</a> &#8211; which is an absolute bargain.</p>
