				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/apr/06/flatpack-film-festival-digbeth-birmingham">An article on the Guardian&#8217;s film blog</a> has asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can Birmingham&#8217;s eclectic lucky dip of a festival help rejuvenate its  Digbeth base?</p></blockquote>
<p>That festival being <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack</a>. Now, I was always told that if the title of a newspaper article asks a question then the answer is most likely &#8216;no&#8217;. In this case, the answer given is revealed to be more like &#8216;well, first of all Digbeth needs a cash machine, some residents, public transport, a post office and some street lighting&#8217;. Which is fair enough.</p>
<p>Hanging the cultural hopes ofÂ  an entire area on one annual festival (no matter how good) was a bit of a reach anyway.</p>
<p>On another matter, two parts of the article jumped out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazingly, points out George Clark, a curator who put together  Flatpack&#8217;s <a title="Build Them in the Mind" href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/build-them-in-mind">Build Them in the Mind</a> programme of  short films, Birmingham still lacks a proper arthouse cinema. This in  England&#8217;s second-largest city.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is true but needs tallying against Ian Francis saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I hate it when people say Birmingham is apathetic&#8221; about film and  culture, he says. &#8220;The interest is there&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is also true.</p>
<p>That there&#8217;s only one independent cinema in Birmingham is a bit of a shocker, but <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/page/3648/cinema">mac</a> reopens soon and don&#8217;t  forget the <a href="http://www.light-house.co.uk/">Light House</a> is  only just up the  road.</p>
<p>Even better, there are quite a few people getting off their backsides to put films on  away from the multiplexes. Film nights are rife &#8211; off the top of my head there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thevictoriabirmingham.co.uk/moving_pictures.htm">Moving Pictures</a>, <a href="http://www.thejekyllandhyde.co.uk/junipercinema.php">Juniper Cinema</a>, Kino Concrete, <a href="http://www.filmrats.co.uk/">Filmrats</a>, <a href="http://www.popcorncomedy.com/">Popcorn</a>, the <a href="http://www.animationforumwm.co.uk/">Animation Forum</a> events, <a href="http://www.birmingham-film.org/">BIFS</a>, <a href="http://www.theploughharborne.co.uk/the-plough-live">Screen Sunday</a> at The Plough and occasional things at The Sunflower Lounge. Those are just the ones I can remember, too. Pretty much all of those are in pubs, which isn&#8217;t always going to be ideal and they&#8217;re unlikely to show the latest releases, but I think Ian&#8217;s right about apathy not being the problem.</p>
