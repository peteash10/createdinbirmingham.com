<p>There is so much to this outstanding opportunity, so I&#8217;ll let the REP explain it better with some info from the <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/participate/creative-development/rep-foundry/">Foundry Page</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>New stories, new voices and new visions of the world. As The REP moves into the next phase in its remarkable history it is looking for emerging directors, writers, theatre makers and companies from across the West Midlands to make the journey with them. Offering a new, yearlong development programme, REP Foundry, will support artists through workshops, making and sharing work and professional mentoring.

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/participate/creative-development/rep-foundry/">REP Foundry</a> will also offer audiences a unique insight into how new theatre is formed and staged at scratch performance nights. Be the first to see work from REP Foundry artists throughout 2013.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>REP Foundry Nights will take place on the last Thursday of the month at 8.00pm on the following dates:</strong></p>
