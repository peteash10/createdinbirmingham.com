				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I meant to post this a few days back but forgot. Oops.</p>
<p>You remember the JFK mosaic that used to be at St Chad&#8217;s Circus before all that area was redeveloped? There&#8217;s talk of relocating it to the Irish Quarter.</p>
<blockquote><p>The mosaic was commissioned in 1968 and paid for by the city’s Irish community as a permanent testament to the murdered American president</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The public consultation meeting will be held at the Irish Centre in Deritend at 6.30pm to 8.30pm.</p>
<p>It has been organised by the Birmingham Irish Community Forum with a view to re-housing the JFK mosaic within the Irish Quarter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quote taken from <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/dailybulletin/news2/2010/07/22/future-of-city-s-jfk-memorial-to-be-decided-65233-26904325/">the Birmingham Post</a> who have more info, <a href="http://digbeth.org/2010/07/community-consultation-for-the-jfk-mosaic-on-22nd-july/">as does Nicky Getgood</a> who delivers the news that refreshments will be available and that:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the community’s chance to let Birmingham City Council know what they’d like to see happen to this unique snap shot of history from the 60’s.  Council suggestions to the BICF have so far included incorporating members of the community into the mosaic</p></blockquote>
<p>Which has the potential to become the mosaic equivalent of a <a href="http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/">photoshop disaster</a>, only with added hubris.</p>
