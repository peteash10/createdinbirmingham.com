<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, last week was <a href="http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/">London Fashion Week</a>. And while some of us can only dream of attending the glamorous shows, the closest we can get to our fashion fantasies is through various blogs and Twitter updates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Birmingham designer <a href="http://www.damianmarquez.com/">Damian Marquez</a> was invited to showcase his S/S11 collection as a part of <a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/">LABB Magazine</a>’s London Fashion Week showcase event, &#8220;<a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/2010/09/labb-emerge-windows-ss-11.html">Emerge</a>&#8221; which took place on Monday at Hoxton Factory.</p>
<blockquote><p>The collection is made  up of playful tailoring, jersey wear and swimwear. Damian, who launched  his design career at Costa Rica Fashion week in 2009, hopes that this  new collection will follow in the footsteps of his A/W 2010 range which  was quickly snapped up by stylists and magazines internationally</p></blockquote>
<p>The collection was both designed and produced from Damian&#8217;s Harborne shop, while those beautifully airy shots from his S/S11 lookbook (above) are also the work of Birmingham photographer <a href="http://www.garazi.co.uk/">Garazi Gardener</a>.</p>
