				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merry Christmas from one and all at Created in Birmingham!</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;d be surprised if anyone is reading this (and to be even more honest, I wrote this a few days back anyway) but, in case it&#8217;s timely, here are a few things on TV that you might be interested in today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birmingham Royal Ballet&#8217;s <em>Cinderella</em>, BBC2 at 3pm</li>
<li>Best of European Opera 2010 (ft Birmingham Opera Company&#8217;s <em>Othello</em>), BBC4 at 7pm</li>
</ul>
<p>Screen WM have done <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/news/detail/1222/screen_wm_supported_projects_including_toast_nativity_hustle_and_more_this_christmas_and_new_year/">a round-up of the festive stuff they&#8217;ve been involved in</a>, including The Brothers McLeod&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.brothersmcleod.co.uk/posts/show/48">The Moon Bird</a></em> (Christmas Day, 12.40am on Channel 4 &#8211; oh, bit late for that, sorry), the new series of <em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x2yj7">Upstairs Downstairs</a></em> (Boxing Day, 9pm on BBC 1), <a href="http://www.nigelslater.com/tv.asp"><em>Toast</em></a> (30 December, 9pm on BBC 1) and, later on in January, the return of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/hustle/"><em>Hustle</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got some vouchers burning a hole in your pocket then <a href="http://www.soulboythefilm.com/">Soulboy</a> and <a href="http://www.nativitythemovie.co.uk/">Nativity</a> are out on DVD.</p>
<p>On the radio side of things, Robin Valk&#8217;s <a href="http://radiotogo.blogspot.com/2010/10/handsworth-evolution-documentary.html">Handsworth Evolution</a> will be played on 30 December on BBC WM.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve not been paying a great deal to <a href="http://www.rhubarbradio.com/">Rhubarb Radio</a> over the past little while, other than my usual subscription to <a href="http://brumcast.podomatic.com/">Brumcast</a> which drops into my iTunes on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t realised they were in any sort of trouble until I read <a href="http://radiotogo.blogspot.com/2010/12/rhubarb-crumble.html">Robin Valk&#8217;s post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last month, there was more bad news. Like many community stations, the eccentric but occasionally quite wonderful <a href="http://www.rhubarbradio.com/">Rhubarb Radio</a> is feeling the cold winds of recession. The current managerial team is bailing out; an intensive effort is being mounted to build a new and solid structure for the continued existence of the station.</p></blockquote>
<p>The campaign to shore up Rhubarb Radio is being coordinated, from what I can tell, by some of the current DJs and contributors via a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-Rhubarb-Radio/172343146128920">&#8216;Save Rhubarb Radio&#8217; Facebook page</a>. There have been a few meetings to work out what&#8217;s going to happen and things seen to be picking up pace, which is good.</p>
<p>However, from flicking through the FB page, there seems to be a short-term financial hurdle to be overcome. <em>It looks like</em> (put some clear info up somewhere you guys!) they&#8217;re need £600 sharpish and are after a few people to chip in £20. There&#8217;s a donate button on the <a href="http://www.rhubarbradio.com/">Rhubarb Radio website</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a meeting at the Custard Factory tonight if you want to help out in any way, that&#8217;s at 7pm in the Orwell Room.</p>
