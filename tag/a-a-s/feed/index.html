<p style="text-align: left;">Artists in residence at <a href="http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/">The New Art Gallery Walsall</a>, <a href="http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/whats-on/event/a-a-s">a.s.s.</a>, are inviting you to join them for 1 hour sleeping sessions as they experiment with lucid dreaming in The Cage.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sessions are taking place at 12 noon and 2pm today, next Sunday 12 December and 14 December, and teams of sleepers will attempt to meet up in The Other Place. They also have a few bits of information on lucid dreaming on <a href="http://theotherplaceportal.net/blog/the-other-place/dreams-the-other-place/am-i-dreaming/">The Other Place blog</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the  lucid dream training we will be building on this by attempting to dream  collectively, trying out different methods and making notes and drawings  based on this. We will be explaining and preparing for lucid dreaming  beforehand, and discussing experiences afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&#8217;d like to participate, make sure you wear comfortable clothes and arrive half an hour before the session&#8217;s due to start. Find out more about a.a.s. events and experiments on the <a href="http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/whats-on/event/a-a-s">website</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk">The New Art Gallery Walsall</a> has recently opened The Cage, where resident artists <a href="http://aasgroup.net/current/">a.a.s</a> invite you to join them as they carry out a series of experiments exploring openings to <em>The Other Place</em>, a  collective space of thought or dreams, the space of the future or  potential, and the collaborative processes or assemblages that produce  those ideas.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you dream? Have you ever imagined something impossible? Do you have hopes for the future? Then you&#8217;re already on the way to <em>The Other Place</em>.</p>
<p>&#8230;Some say that when we are awake we are dealing mostly with  illusion. This would mean that <em>The Other Place</em> is the PRIMARY Reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this intrigues you, every Saturday a.a.s will be in the artists&#8217; studio or out in Walsall where they&#8217;ll be performing experiments to explore <em>The Other Place</em>. They will also be hosting the following events until the end of the project, which runs until 16 January;</p>
<p><strong>How to shuffle perspective game book correction rule do it meeting</strong><br />
27 November 2010</p>
<blockquote><p>As  a response to the Arnolfini artistÕs book works collection, a.a.s will  be using William BurroughsÕ cut-up technique to generate new  instructions from existing performance scores.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Interstitial Stone Portal Ritual </strong><br />
31 December 2010 &#8211; 1 January 2011</p>
<blockquote><p>At  the change between years in the Gregorian Calendar, The Nagual will  create a portal in a stone circle, to bring about the time of intersect,  a sliding between realities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>XE-54</strong><br />
4 – 16 January 2011</p>
<blockquote><p>Over  the last two weeks of the residency, you will have the chance to take  part in an ongoing performance fiction, and play games with the levels  of reality developed over the project.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://trove.org.uk/">TROVE&#8217;s</a> next exhibition <a href="http://trove.org.uk/exhibitions/show-of-science/">Show of Science</a> presents four artists, including a.a.s., Victoria Jenkins, Lee Stowers and Luke  Williams, exhibiting in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Science_and_Industry,_Birmingham">Jewellery Quarter&#8217;s old science museum</a>. Here&#8217;s what TROVE have said about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>All pieces hint at the historic, at first glance  there is nothing suspicious or out of the ordinary, though with closer  inspection there is something odd about the works. The double take  allows this <em>Show of Science </em>to move from a series of simple  objects of science to pieces that make you question its use, its  reliability as official face and of the make believe.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a preview of the exhibition on <strong>Friday 30th April,  6 – 8pm</strong> and the exhibition will be open from 30th April – 16th May by appointment. If you want to check it out, contact <a href="charlie@TROVE.org.uk">Charlie</a> or <a href="david@TROVE.org.uk">David</a> at TROVE.</p>
