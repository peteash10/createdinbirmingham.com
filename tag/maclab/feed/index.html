&#8220;mac invites applications from artists in all disciplines to apply for an intensive lab based residency at our new facilities in Birmingham. We want to hear from artists that are interested in working outside of their normal practice or &#8216;safe&#8217; area.  Open to any form of practice &#8211; we want applications from musicians, film-makers, visual artists, performers, live artists, photographers, digital media practitioners and anyone working across media&#8221;</li>

&#8220;We’ve just come back from a Birmingham City Council consultation meeting about the cities ‘Music Industry’. Over the 10 years we’ve been doing Capsule related activity we’ve been invited to a fair few of these things and still very little seems to have moved on&#8221;. There&#8217;s a good discussion going in the comments, go have a look</li>
