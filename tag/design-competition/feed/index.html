				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well folks, the deadline for the Created in Birmingham design competition is looming so if you would like to enter you need to email them over to <a href="mailto:createdinbirmingham@gmail.com" target="_blank">createdinbirmingham [at] gmail.com</a> by Friday.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3194 aligncenter" title="ciblabel" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ciblabel.jpg" alt="ciblabel" width="425" height="262" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ciblabel.jpg 425w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ciblabel-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /><br />
This is the last call for submissions and here is how it will work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can submit a design entry to the competition, as long as you follow the specifications needed for printing.</li>
<li>From the entries 20 final designs will be chosen and made into 50 limited edition pin badge sets.</li>
<li>One final design will be chosen and will be made into 50 limited edition t-shirts and 50 limited edition canvas bags.</li>
<li>All items will be lovingly screenprinted by hand and sold online by <a href="http://cutoutshop.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Cut &#8211; Out</a>, a fantasic DIY print company based in the West Midlands. All items will be printed with eco friendly inks and on top quality <a href="http://www.earthpositiveonline.com/" target="_blank">Earth Positive</a> apparel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The brief:</strong></p>
<p>We want to make a t-shirt that people will really want to wear, so the brief is very loose. The emphasis here is celebrating creative talent in Birmingham and raising some money in the process. You could design something which reflects the creativity of the city, or just your own style, itâ€™s up to you!</p>
<p><strong>Submission guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The design should work using one colour, if the image is a photograph it needs to be converted to half tone.</li>
<li>The design you submit needs to be 300 dpi (usual print quality).</li>
<li>The design should be no bigger than A3 in size.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deadline: Friday 6th March 5pm.</strong> Send your design as a PDF or JPG file to</p>
