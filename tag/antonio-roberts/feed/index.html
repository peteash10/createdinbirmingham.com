				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Birmingham&#8217;s bidding for the title of City of Culture in 2013 and as a result a couple of attempts to get your feedback have been launched.</p>
<p><strong>Big Blank Canvas</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://canvasbirmingham.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-4433 aligncenter" title="Big Blank Canvas-1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Big-Blank-Canvas-1.jpg" alt="Big Blank Canvas-1" width="500" height="321" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Big-Blank-Canvas-1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Big-Blank-Canvas-1-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://canvasbirmingham.com/">Big Blank Canvas</a> is a project managed and devised by <a href="http://www.fiercetv.co.uk/">Fierce</a> (on behalf of the council who are responsible for the bid itself) which, in its first version, is asking people:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you do in your cultural life in Birmingham, and where?</li>
<li>What would you like to see happen as part of Birmingham City of Culture in 2013, and where?</li>
<li>Where would you like to have a cultural experience in Birmingham?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://canvasbirmingham.com/category/would-like-to-do/">The second question</a> has generated the most interesting ideas so far. Here are a few that jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote><p>a touring show for kids and families playing a different suburban park every weekend in the summer hols; with locals creating and participating (from Rob)</p>
<p>Literal street art – a day with no traffic when the streets can be used as a gigantic canvas by communities all over the city, free balloon flights to view the full effect… (from Mark Scourse)</p>
<p>Shut down all the major cultural institutions for a month and promote/support cultural events and activities across the outer city in non traditional venues (from The Blade)</p></blockquote>
<p>The aim is for the site to be up in this form for the next couple of months, after which it&#8217;ll change somehow &#8211; responding to the ideas people put forward.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Blank-Canvas/221401070725">Facebook Page</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/BigBlankCanvas">Twitter account</a> you can follow to keep up with what people are suggesting.</p>
<p>I should also say (for the purposes of disclosure) that I&#8217;ve done some work with Fierce on the concept/design behind this one.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Birmingham &#8211; Have Your Say!</strong></p>
<p>This is the bit that has been aimed specifically at under-25&#8217;s. Antonio Roberts was asked to get involved with the steering group for this and <a href="http://www.hellocatfood.com/2009/11/30/birmingham-city-of-culture/">has written up some info</a> about it. Again, it&#8217;s an online consultation exercise:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a <a href="http://www.hellocatfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Birmingham_for_City_of_Culture_Questionnaire_cyp.doc">three-page questionnaire</a> that young ‘uns can fill out, but more interestingly I think it’d be better to get involved in the discussion on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=208456101059">Facebook Group</a> (liek wot all da cool kids iz doin)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>G&#8217;wan, have a go</strong></p>
<p>Irrespective of the City of Culture bid, it&#8217;d be nice to show that folks around these parts really care about the cultural life of the city they live in and have some good ideas for how to build on/show off what we&#8217;ve got. Go nuts and use this to air your wildest dreams, fervent passions or give a mention to those things that you&#8217;ve seen elsewhere and wish would happen in Birmingham.</p>

Interesting post from Kenny at Big Cat pondering what direction a large-ish, credible venue should take in terms of booking acts. Would be interesting to see what people would suggest</li>

Interesting from the Crescent Theatre &#8211; they&#8217;ve got a production of Winnie-the-Pooh coming in the new year. A comment on a previous blog asked whether Pooh would be played in full, semi or no costume. Here&#8217;s the answer (maybe drop them a comment on your thoughts)</li>

Not sure what this is, but it&#8217;s to do with Antonio Roberts so it&#8217;ll probably be interesting</li>

I can&#8217;t find a copy but it looks like it could be a blimmin interesting/useful document to get your mitts on. Can anyone find this online?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/news/?id=518">Young People Arts Project: New Project Opportunity &#8211; Audiences Central</a><br />
&#8220;Audiences Central, with arts consultant Kerry Endsor, is looking to develop and deliver a high-profile, public-facing, arts project that will encourage and inspire young people in the West Midlands to engage with the arts and culture&#8221;. If you&#8217;re interested in getting involved then register your interest on the Audiences Central site before 19 Dec</li>

A couple of the Audiences Central peeps have started their own blogs recently, with this one from Fiona likely to be the most, um, quirky. She has/had a secret obsession &#8211; rating the city&#8217;s (and likely other cities&#8217;) toilets. So far pubs and restaurants feature highly</li>
