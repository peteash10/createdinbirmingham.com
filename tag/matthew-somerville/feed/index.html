				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I was at <a href="http://culturehackday.org.uk/">Culture Hack Day</a>, where teams of developers came together to create things using data from cultural organisations (it had nothing to do with breaking into computers and nicking personal info &#8211; that&#8217;s different).</p>
<p>There were a fair few people from Birmingham who went along and they had access to a week&#8217;s worth of West Midlands listings data provided by <a href="http://www.globaldatapoint.com/">Global Data Point</a>, which <a href="http://www.marketingbirmingham.com/">Marketing Birmingham</a> had a hand in arranging, so here&#8217;s a list of the kind of things they made.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/markjames">Mark James</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewlowther">Andrew Lowther</a> from <a href="http://mademedia.co.uk/">Made Media</a> made a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cultureapp.dyndns.org/">LuvvieScore</a> highlights cultural hotspots in UK (well, just Birmingham at the moment). <a href="http://cultureapp.dyndns.org/?search=B5%205SE">CiB&#8217;s office</a> rates as an &#8216;A-List Badger Fossil&#8217;, happily</li>
<li><a href="http://mark.james.name/tescofresco/">TescoFresco</a> maps the location of theatres and branches of Tescos (pic below with theatres in red, Tescos in blue)</li>
<li>Following a request, they did the same thing with <a href="http://mark.james.name/tescofresco/libraries.php">Tescos and libraries</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://mark.james.name/tescofresco/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8769" title="TescoFresco" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/TescoFresco.jpg" alt="TescoFresco" width="550" height="348" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/TescoFresco.jpg 550w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/TescoFresco-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dracos">Matthew Somerville</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/clarelovell">Clare Lovell</a> made <a href="http://pepysshows.co.uk/">Pepys&#8217; Shows</a>, featuring the extracts from Samuel Pepys&#8217; diaries where he reviews trips to the theatre.</p>
<p><a href="http://steflewandowski.com/">Stef Lewandowski</a> (previously from around these parts, so he&#8217;s allowed it in this round-up) was busy too:</p>
<ul>
<li>He simplified access to 1m+ artifacts in the Culture Grid API by providing Ruby access (<a href="https://github.com/stefl/culturegrid">ruby gem here</a>)</li>
<li>In case it wasn&#8217;t obvious, he then <a href="http://culturegridapp.heroku.com">made a mobile app to show what that means</a></li>
<li>And finally he was involved in <a href="http://filmflexicon.heroku.com/">Filmflexicon</a> which cross-references on-demand films and rating from <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of hacks, which included a service that uses Foursquare check-ins to work out when galleries and museums are at their busiest and Subvertle &#8211; a framework for playing with iPlayer subtitles, should be on the <a href="http://culturehackday.org.uk/">Culture Hack Day website</a> later.</p>
<p>On the Saturday there were some talks too. If you&#8217;re interested in what all that was about then I&#8217;ve written up quite a few notes on the <a href="http://meshedmedia.com/the-lightning-talks-at-culture-hack-day/">Meshed Media website</a>.</p>
<p>(* yes, so it should have been Culture Hack Weekend)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Theatricalia.jpg" rel="lightbox[4060]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4065" title="Theatricalia" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Theatricalia.jpg" alt="Theatricalia" width="430" height="126" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Theatricalia.jpg 430w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Theatricalia-300x87.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>First up, <a href="http://theatricalia.com">Theatricalia</a> is the work of the ever-impressive <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/">Matthew Somerville</a>. It&#8217;s &#8216;a database of past and future theatre productions&#8217; which makes it no less than <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> for theatre.</p>
<p>Already it contains archives of plays and performers from the RSC, Bristol University Archive, the Royal National Theatre and Birmingham Rep (1913-1971). You can search by play, person or place and edit entries yourself to help the archive grow.</p>
<p>The potential for <a href="http://theatricalia.com/">Theatricalia</a> is a little mind-boggling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Black-Routes.jpg" rel="lightbox[4060]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4066" title="Black Routes" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Black-Routes.jpg" alt="Black Routes" width="500" height="102" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Black-Routes.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Black-Routes-300x61.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackroutes.org.uk/">Black Routes</a> is a new UK wide touring network for African and Caribbean music, with <a href="http://www.punch-records.co.uk/">Punch Records</a> as one of the founding partners and chair.</p>
<p>Punch&#8217;s Ammo Talwar wrote an <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/business-comment/2009/10/26/ammo-talwar-radical-change-is-here-to-stay-65233-25012834/">article in the Birmingham Post</a> explaining the context for the project, particularly how it fits in with what&#8217;s happening in Birmingham at the moment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" rel="lightbox[2035]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2043" title="artsfest1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="187" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> is a big sprawling beast of a festival and a difficult one to wrangle from a listings perspective. A few people have chipped in with their take on how things could/should be presented but for me, while all of them help in some way, none of them really hit the nail on the head.Â  Still here are they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every event has been manfully wrangled into the <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/events/search?search=artsfest">Live Brum database</a></li>
<li>Jon Bounds has <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/5572128/Artsfest-Programme">scanned the programme and put it online</a></li>
<li>He&#8217;s also put together <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100285685412338791851.00045623f1c67b8d55eb9&amp;ll=52.478298,-1.904819&amp;spn=0.006051,0.018883&amp;z=16">a map showing what&#8217;s happening where</a> (but not when)</li>
<li>Matthew Somerville from <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/">Dracos.co.uk</a> has put together a <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/play/artsfest/">searchable list of events listed by time</a>, not location</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the small team running Artsfest wouldn&#8217;t have the budget or reach to put something like the above together, so it&#8217;s great to see the local community take it upon themselves.</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s of any use to anyone, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m planning to do.Â  Or at least what I think looks interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Friday evening</strong></p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s fun takes place against the backdrop of <a href="http://www.lightnight.co.uk/">Light Night</a>, of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stan&#8217;s Cafe are opening the doors of AE Harris Factory (110 Northwood Street, B3 1SZ) for Of All The People In All The World (6.30-9pm)</li>
<li>From 7pm (not sure until when) there are two interesting things happening at the Council House.Â  Definitely worth seeing are <a href="http://www.willard-wigan.com/">Willard Wigan&#8217;s astounding micro sculptures</a>.Â  Sonia Bhamra will be Painting With Light in another room which might be worth a look if you&#8217;re there</li>
<li>Gallery 10 at BM&amp;AG has <a href="http://www.comfortism.co.uk/">Comfortism</a> who, I think, mixes up poetry, theatre and stand-up with the odd bit of audience participation.Â  Could be interesting</li>
<li>At 8pm there&#8217;s a parade from the Pavillions to Centenary Square</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/late-night-light-night">Town Hall present Late Night Light Night</a> and they&#8217;ll be open from 8pm for perfomances by Soweto Kinch, The Sub Ensemble, Manga and Maylight (who I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s the tricky one.Â  There&#8217;s loads happening so the best thing might just be to go for a wander around the city centre and see what you stumble across.Â  That said&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nic Gaunt&#8217;s exhibition &#8216;<a href="http://www.newrotunda.co.uk/about%20the%20project.html">The Rotunda: 21 Stories</a>&#8216; will be at The Pavillions all day</li>
<li>From 3.30pm to 4.30pm there&#8217;s Raw Magic which is &#8220;a visual installation and promenade performance built into a maze of tents, for audiences to explore and choose which direction they would like to take&#8221;.Â  Some of the people here were involved in the very popular B1 Labyrinths from this year&#8217;s Fierce Festival</li>
<li>From 8pm to 10pm BRB, CBSO and Birmingham Opera Company share the Centenary Square stage for one of the weekend&#8217;s big items.Â  Plus there&#8217;ll be fireworks.</li>
<li>After that it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/">Project X Presents</a> for me.Â  It&#8217;s not Artsfest-related but it does look pretty exciting, so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I&#8217;m functioning at 12pm then I&#8217;ll want some &#8216;beautiful heartwarming acoustic/electronica music&#8217;.Â  At the Custard Factory, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/elliotjack">Elliot Jack</a> will be playingjust that.</li>
<li>After that I might wander into the Custard Factory Theatre for some short flicks courtesy of Shortcuts</li>
<li>From 7pm <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/08/19/needle-thread-theatre-presents-between-the-lines/">Needle &amp; Thread Theatre are doing the rather charming-looking &#8216;Between The Lines&#8217;</a> &#8211; walking theatre around the Central Library.Â  This is on on Saturday too (call 07530 939 380 to book a free place)</li>
<li>It&#8217;s Kerrangfest in Centenary Square from 12pm with The Mexicolas, The Metros, Envy &amp; Other Sins and The Levellers later in the evening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, whether I actually get round a fraction of all of that is another question.</p>
