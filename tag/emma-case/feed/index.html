It&#8217;s technically their last day tomorrow but their pub-based send off was last night. Good luck to everyone who&#8217;s moving on. For now: &#8220;This website is part of the legacy for Audiences Central, the regional audience development agency for the West Midlands (2004-2012)&#8221; The links page is very useful</li>

Hello. I hadn&#8217;t spotted this before: &#8220;All About Audiences will be managing a contract from Warwickshire County Council previously delivered by Audiences Central to coordinate audience development support in the county during 2012/13&#8221;</li>

One of those round-ups of what everyone&#8217;s written about the festival. I like these.</li>
<li><a href="http://birminghamarchitecture.ning.com/profiles/blogs/vivid-pod-space-for-sale">VIVID POD SPACE FOR SALE &#8211; Architecture WM</a><br />
The VIVID Pod prototype is arguably the first manufactured, mobile artist’s space in the UK. The pod concept was developed by architect Ranbir Lal in collaboration with VIVID in response to VIVID&#8217;s artist research programme; it explores the possibilities of integrating production within an exhibition environment.</li>
