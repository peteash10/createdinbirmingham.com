				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Birmingham a city where it is easy to collaborate with others?</p>
<p>I arrived in Birmingham in the summer of 2006, tasked with preparing  <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">Town Hall</a> for its anticipated re-opening, due to happen 18 months later  at the end of 2007. Although I had lived in the Midlands during my  school years, I didn’t really know Birmingham, and so had no idea how it  would feel to live and work in the City, despite the reassurances from a  few friendly faces I knew prior to my arrival.</p>
<p>Since then, I have worked closely with my colleague Paul Keene (Director  of Programming for THSH) to build new relationships with artists,  producers, promoters, other arts organisations, and civic and community  groups.  The most refreshing aspect of working in Birmingham has been  experiencing just how easy it is to meet people and “do business”.   Despite the huge amount of creative work taking place here, I quickly  found that everyone knows everyone, and really there’s no excuse not to  be working together and sharing ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/page/town-hall-birmingham/town-hall-image-gallery/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9509" title="Town Hall" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall-.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="263" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall-.jpg 712w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Town-Hall--300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></a><br />
Our approach has always been to get out of Town Hall and to try and see  as many other things as possible, both to support the work of others,  but also to get a real understanding of how <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">THSH</a> fits into the creative  network of the City.  When your day job is overseeing a hall which  presents 300 different events a year, it’s important to remember to get  off the daily hamster wheel and make the time to meet with colleagues  from other arts organisations, as that tends to be how the interesting  new ideas and projects begin to take shape.</p>
<p>This week, Town Hall have hosted <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a> and <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/home/">Flatpack</a> in two exciting events  (<a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/mirror-mirror-the-irrepressibles">The Irrepressibles</a>, and <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/digging-for-gold">Digging For Gold</a>), and we are very proud to be  involved as partners in both festivals. The Irrepressibles show came  about because Laura from Fierce and I were both at a previous  Irrepressibles show in St Martin’s Church as part of last year’s <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/">SHOUT  Queer Festival</a>, and we were both blown away by what we heard. A couple  of quick discussions later, and a chat with Jamie from the  Irrepressibles, and we had agreed to jointly work together to bring the  group back to Birmingham for Fierce. With Flatpack, we have always kept  in touch with Ian and Pip, and following their big <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/2009/festival/event/curzonora">Curzonora</a> project two  years ago, we were keen to work with them to bring another Flatpack  project to Town Hall. By taking our successful existing silent film with  organ accompaniment format, and adapting it to include improvised piano  and some shorter films, we have been able to add to Flatpack’s focus  this year on archivist Iris Barry.</p>
<p>We are also preparing for our major <a href="http://www.symphonyhall.co.uk/page/contact-us/press-office/stravinsky-s-rite-of-spring-3d/">Rite of Spring 3D project</a>, taking  place on April 21st, and performed by the <a href="http://www.cbso.co.uk/">CBSO</a> with dancer Julia Mach  and artistic director Klaus Obermaier. We have made the financial  commitment to ensure that this extraordinary project is presented in  Birmingham, but as always, we want to work with our partners to ensure  that all the potential audiences get to hear about it, and we don’t  serve Birmingham audiences best by just doing that by ourselves.</p>
<p>That approach to the marketing strategy for the Rite of Spring project  runs through all of our work at THSH – we will always work with partners  wherever we can, whether it is us guaranteeing the fees and costs for a  project, or through more straightforward marketing and  cross-promotional relationships.  For example, if we are promoting The  Dhol Foundation in concert at Town Hall, we will work with <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/">The Drum</a>, <a href="http://www.sampad.org.uk/"> sampad</a>, <a href="http://punch-records.co.uk/">Punch</a>, <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/music-service">Birmingham Music Service</a> and independent promoters to  ensure that we utilise as many avenues as possible to spread the word on  the show, and to help develop an audience for the artists. We are also  talking to the <a href="http://www.birminghamjazz.co.uk/">Birmingham Jazz</a> team on a weekly basis, sharing ideas for  future projects, and working together to promote performances such as  the recent Uri Caine/Mahler concert, as part of the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/the-birmingham-mahler-cycle">Birmingham Mahler  Cycle</a>.</p>
<p>On a national basis, we’re working with promoters and festivals  including <a href="http://www.serious.org.uk/">Serious</a>, who collaborate with us to ensure that artists  including Mariza, Staff Benda Bilili and Salif Keita are performing in  Birmingham as part of their limited UK tour plans. Serious and other  promoters who represent touring artists are keen to include Birmingham,  but this will only happen if an organisation like THSH is prepared to  invest and commit to the artists, as these concerts rarely stand up on a  purely commercial arrangement.</p>
<p>So, back to my original question – is Birmingham a city where it is easy  to collaborate with others?  Five years on, we can look back over a  very broad range of collaborations, some of which were for one-off  occasions, and some which have since evolved into an ongoing  relationship. I believe that collaboration is definitely one of the  things that Birmingham does best, and we should be proud of what we can  achieve by working together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack</a> and <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org">Fierce</a> have barely begun, but I&#8217;ve already been taking a sneak peek of a few of the things they&#8217;ve got going on, including <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing Room</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> and a trip over to the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/events/?venue=the-dirty-end">Dirty End</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9494" title="symphony of a missing room" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="385" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg 605w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yesterday morning I headed over to <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a>, for a visit unlike any other. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing</em> Room by Lundahl &amp; Seitl</a>, feeling slightly apprehensive as I was given a pair of wireless headphones, blindfolded and led cautiously around the museum by sounds, voices and a mysterious hand. The whole experience was what I can only describe as dream like, and had me leaving feeling like I&#8217;d been awoken from a deep, disorienting sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far it&#8217;s been receiving plenty of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/symphony%20of%20a%20missing%20room">rave reviews on Twitter</a>, who all seem to be able to put the experience into words so much better than I can. If you want to check it out for yourself, <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room">book via the Fierce website</a>, it&#8217;s definitely one to give a go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last night also saw the launch of both Flatpack and Fierce, at <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>, which has been transformed into The Dirty End. Along with live music from <a href="http://www.juneauprojects.co.uk/">Juneau Projects</a>, they had a few tasty treats and cocktails on offer which will apparently be sticking around for most of the festival.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vintagemobilecinema.co.uk/">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> had it&#8217;s first Flatpack outing this afternoon in Victoria Square, where it gathered quite a few admirers. The 22 seater restored mobile cinema, originally toured British factories from 1967, promoting modern production methods. As one of only seven made, this gem is the last standing after being brought back to life to tour the country once again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9493" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With it&#8217;s cosy little interior, complete with red cinema seats, it feels rather like a mini <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/">Electric</a>. I was also treated to a clip of Buster Keaton&#8217;s silent film <em>Sherlock Junior</em> (1924), which is being screening tomorrow night at the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/an-evening-of-silent-film-and-live-music">Town Hall</a>, accompanied by live organ and piano.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9495" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>If you fancy hopping aboard, the vintage mobile cinema will be at Handsworth Library on Thursday, Birmingham Markets on Saturday, and Cannon Hill Park on Sunday. Take a look at whats on across the weekend over on the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Flatpack site</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and update this post with other Flatpack &amp; Fierce adventures, but in the meantime let us know which events you&#8217;ve made it to and what should be on our &#8216;must see&#8217; lists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time a disgruntled promoter will write something accusing the people of Birmingham of being an apathetic bunch who&#8217;d rather stay at home than go out and have a good time. See <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/02/05/a-round-up-of-some-recent-music-discussions/">this post from a year ago</a> for an example.</p>
<p>James Cook has joined this cohort with a post titled &#8216;<a title="Post detail page of &quot;Why the Birmingham comedy scene repeatedly dies on its hole...&quot;" href="http://nottheexplorer.blog.co.uk/2011/02/28/why-the-birmingham-comedy-scene-repeatedly-dies-on-its-hole-10718505/">Why the Birmingham comedy scene repeatedly dies on its hole&#8230;</a>&#8216;. His gripes are that (and I apologise for paraphrasing):</p>
<ul>
<li>research shows that residents of Birmingham are the most risk averse in the country. We have a drinking culture, but not much of a &#8216;going out&#8217; culture. This makes things difficult for promoters</li>
<li>there are too many poor quality comedy night charging people good money to see new, unpaid acts. These nights are rubbish and will put people off ever going to a comedy night again</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim to know too much about this &#8211; I go to the occasional stand-up show, but I don&#8217;t have James&#8217;s experience of the local comedy scene and he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/2010/01/28/engaging-regional-audiences-how-do-we-do-it/#comment-32039877">not the first</a> to have made this complaint. However, from a lay punter&#8217;s point of view, I was under the impression that if comedy&#8217;s your thing then Birmingham caters for you pretty well. We&#8217;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.thenia.co.uk/">NIA</a> and <a href="http://www.lgarena.co.uk/">LG Arena</a> for the big, mainstream touring shows</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">Town Hall</a> and <a href="http://www.alexandratheatre.org.uk/">Alexandra Theatre</a> for other biggish touring shows</li>
<li>two main stand-up venues &#8211; <a href="http://www.glee.co.uk/">The Glee Club</a> and <a href="http://www.thehighlight.co.uk/birmingham/upcoming-shows">Highlight</a></li>
<li>other occasional shows at <a href="http://www.thepublic.com/">The Public</a> and the <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">MAC</a>. <a href="http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/">Warwick Arts Centre</a> and various places in Wolverhampton are fairly close too</li>
<li>some smaller, regular nights bringing in some decent national names (<a href="http://www.comedyjunction.co.uk/">Comedy Junction</a> and <a href="http://www.popcorncomedy.com/category/locations/birmingham/">Popcorn Comedy</a>)</li>
<li>there&#8217;s a proliferation of other, smaller nights at pubs and bars around over the city too</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of general promotion, we&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">dedicated comedy website</a> and (almost?) every year the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> draws a ring around a load of shows happening over the space of a month and shouts about them.</p>
<p>That seems like a pretty healthy spread to me. Certainly a good deal more than many other towns and cities can claim. Does it constitute a &#8216;scene&#8217;? If not, is it just the audiences for the smaller gigs that are missing, or something else?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested in hearing what people think. Or, seeing as how he started the discussion, leave a comment on <a href="http://nottheexplorer.blog.co.uk/2011/02/28/why-the-birmingham-comedy-scene-repeatedly-dies-on-its-hole-10718505/">James&#8217;s post</a>.</p>
