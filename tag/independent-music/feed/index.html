				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After contact from a group drawn from <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/">Birmingham City Council</a> and <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/">Arts Council England</a>, <a href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/">The Music Network</a> has asked <a href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/2010/01/13/10-questions-for-birminghams-independent-music-industry/">10 open questions</a> to begin to determine an overview of the current state, needs, and potential of the independent music industry in Birmingham.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hope there&#8217;d be lot of strong views in this area, so if you&#8217;ve got something to say, you&#8217;ve got until 24th January to respond. Below are the 10 questions, which are also available in a handy <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dE5PSXYyZkpyZzMtNTJxN0dxWko4RUE6MA">Google survey here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. In your view, what is the current state of the region’s “Independent Music Industry?”</p>
<p>2. What do you think are it’s immediate needs with reference to the areas that you are most familiar with?</p>
<p>3. As far as the region’s “Independent Music Industry” is concerned, what do you think shows the greatest potential for the next few years?</p>
<p>4. In recent years, there has been a range of initiatives and projects designed to support the development of music in Birmingham. Can you list 5 projects or initiatives that you think have proved beneficial to the “Independent Music Industry?”</p>
<p>5. Can you list any projects or initiatives that you think have proved “of little use or benefit” to the “Independent Music Industry?”</p>
<p>6. With regard to your answers to questions 4 and 5, do you think Birmingham should continue to pursue the idea of more initiatives and projects designed to support the development of music in Birmingham?</p>
<p>7. If you could make any changes to, or include any new ideas for, any “strategy for supporting the development of music in Birmingham” what would your top priorities be?</p>
<p>8. If you were given the task of evaluating whether a project or initiative had been successful, what would you suggest as the best indicators of success, failure, benefit or disaster for the “Independent Music Industry?”</p>
<p>9. As far as your knowledge or understanding of the region’s “Independent Music Industry” is concerned, what are it’s greatest strengths, and what are it’s greatest weaknesses?</p>
<p>10. If you could do anything to “support the development of music in Birmingham” what would you do and why would you choose to do that?</p></blockquote>
<p>The Music Network would also like you to send any comments, links, articles or opinions that may be useful to<a href="mailto:info@birminghammusicnetwork.com">info@birminghammusicnetwork.com</a>. Otherwise, they say, &#8220;a decision will be made on your behalf without any reference to you, and you may not benefit from any strategy that gets agreed and put into action&#8221;.</p>
