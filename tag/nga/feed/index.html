<p>In case you&#8217;ve not been following it, it&#8217;s an &#8216;alternate reality game&#8217; (although I prefer their description of &#8216;a framework for exploring your surroundings&#8217;) and is part of the <a href="http://www.newgenerationarts.co.uk/">New Generation Arts Festival</a>.</p>
<p>Explaining what The Game involves is a little tricky but its main component is playfulness, which is hopefully enough to get you interested.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still plenty of time to take part though and even a couple of workshops to help you on the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://emergentgame.org.uk/sapiens/introductory_sessions/">Workshop 1</a> is at Rooty&#8217;s in the Custard Factory tonight (2 June).  Drop in any time between 4.30pm and 7pm.</li>
<li><a href="http://emergentgame.org.uk/sapiens/introductory_sessions/">Workshop 2</a> will be at BCU&#8217;s Dept of Fine Art on Margaret Street (just behind the BM&amp;AG) between 2pm and 4pm on Friday 6 June.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;ll be a sackful of toys and assorted items/materials for customising your new Luden.  You can also get involved in devising the street games that will be played later in the month.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an existing player then don&#8217;t bring your avatar, whatever you do.</p>
<p>If none of this makes the slightest bit of sense then all will be revealed on the <a href="http://emergentgame.org.uk/">Emergent Game</a> website.  Well, some will be revealed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A free, one-off performance will take place at <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/news/5/2008/new_ikon_eastside_space/">Ikon Eastside</a> at 10pm on Tuesday 3 June.</p>
<p>The Society of Futopia has been developed by four final year students at BIAD, Birmingham City University and will take place during the <a href="http://www.newgenerationarts.co.uk/">New Generation Arts Festival</a>.  One of the artists, <a href="http://garethbarnett.blogspot.com/">Gareth Burnett</a> did have a blog he was using as a diary &#8211; there&#8217;s some interesting stuff there but that seems to have petered out.  According to the artists:</p>
<blockquote><p>The performance is rooted in Futurist Theatre and mixes live performance with film and animation; at its core it is an exploration of the human condition. There is a level of interaction with the audience; instead of conventional lighting the audience will be given torches to discover the characters themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, rather more excitingly:</p>
<blockquote><p>In violence we worship beauty. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. This is the truth according to the Society of Futopia.</p></blockquote>
<p>The performance will also be filmed and exhibited alongside a set of photographs based around science and genetics in the future, religious structures and the human condition. This exhibition runs from 17th June &#8211; 20th June.  On the subject of filming, here&#8217;s a trailer they prepared earlier:</p>
