				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty great opportunity for some free incubation space at the prestigious address of <a href="http://www.birmingham-chamber.com/">Birmingham Chamber of Commerce</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://bxlworks.org.uk/">BXL</a> are offering free desk space in a fully networked office, along with access to a vast database of schools and businesses in Birmingham and Solihull.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? Nothing comes for free? Okay, in return for your free space you also have to commit to giving up a bit of your time, by sharing your expertise to support BXL&#8217;s work in schools, which to be fair, is still a good deal.</p>
<p>If this sounds intriguing, they&#8217;re open to suggestions and ideas of how their work can work together with others, so get in touch with Chris Bishop at <strong><a href="mailto:chris.bishop@bxlworks.org.uk">chris.bishop@bxlworks.org.uk</a></strong> or call on <strong>07919887212</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I went along to a meeting  at Birmingham Chamber of Commerce to see what&#8217;s being done about forming the new Local Enterprise Partnerships (you may recall I mentioned these the other week). I might write up the event sometime, but I&#8217;ve got a feeling that things will have moved on again before I get the chance, so I&#8217;ll just pull out a couple of threads here.</p>
<p>I went along to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>what kinds of issues are being discussed</li>
<li>how the artistic/cultural/wider creative interests of the city are being represented</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as the issues being discussed are concerned, things seem to still be at an early stage. The main topic of discussion was what we might want a LEP to be responsible for and the responses were fairly wide-ranging. Bear in mind that the deadline for proposals to government is a month away and that other large areas around the country have already come to agreement and are settled and you start to get the picture.</p>
<p>From my position as a lay person in all of this, there seemed to have been two widely held opinions from the business folk in the room &#8211; we need to get on and do something fast and the local political infighting needs to stop.</p>
<p>The latter was put rather more strongly by some, but you didn&#8217;t sit through a two hour meeting in which that was the only light relief, so I&#8217;m keeping the exact phrases to myself. Next week I&#8217;m going to go to a nice exhibition or something and report back on that.</p>
<p>As for creative industries representation, a rough headcount revealed six of us &#8211; Lee and Rachel from <a href="http://www.fullrange.co.uk/">Fullrange</a>, Julia from <a href="http://www.aquila-tv.com/">Aquila</a>, Lorraine from <a href="http://www.weavemarketing.co.uk/">Weave Marketing</a> and <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/">Creative Republic</a>, a lady from <a href="http://www.toye.com">Toye Kenning &amp; Spencer</a> (I can&#8217;t find her name just now) and myself. There may well have been others.</p>
<p>I also clocked <a href="http://www.hammonds.com/Default.aspx?sID=14&amp;cID=50400&amp;ctID=36">Anne O&#8217;Meara</a> who deserves a mention. She&#8217;s a fantastically experienced property/regeneration lawyer (and my one-time boss, as it goes) who also chairs the CBSO and has been named by Arts &amp; Business as <a href="http://www.artsandbusiness.org.uk/News/2010/july/midlands-cultural-champions.aspx">a Midlands Cultural Champion</a>. She was there too and a good reminder that there are some people on the business/financial side of town that are committed to the arts/culture cause too.</p>
