				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One for the font-worriers this (and I know there are a few who read this blog). UKType are organising <a href="http://www.uktype.com/index.php?typographic-horizons-17">Typographic Horizons</a> at BIAD on 18 November 2009.</p>
<p>The programme includes a fair amount of local talent (I&#8217;m no expert in this area but I recognise the names of David Osbaldestin, <a href="http://www.doesntcostapenny.com/">Smile</a>, Ben Waddington and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auj6qqfoKGY">Baskerville Project</a>) with some international flavour added by Henrik Birkvig from the <a href="http://www.dmjx.dk/">Danish School of Media &amp; Journalism</a> and John D Berry from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Typography">Microsoft Typography</a> in Seattle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s £25 for most folks, £15 concessions. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.uktype.com/index.php?programme-8">full programme</a> and you can <a href="http://www.uktype.com/index.php?registration">register here</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Smile, they <a href="http://blog.wearesmile.com/post/233965171/when-smile-met-airside">went to visit Airside</a> recently and written it all up on their blog. Well worth a read. This quote from <a href="http://www.jamiewieck.com/">Jamie Wieck</a> stood out:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re now a design company competing with advertising companies that have design and digital design subsidiaries. They know how to talk… some call it strategy, others might call it hot air, but either way we have to learn a bit of that now in order to compete.”</p></blockquote>

Can anyone help Stereographic out?  They need:<br />

Due to launch in 2009, debut magazine proposes to &#8220;provide a platform from which creative people, whether artists, musicians, designers or performers to showcase their talents to a wider audience&#8221;.  They&#8217;re after some of those &#8216;creative individuals&#8217; to be part of the first edition</li>
<li><a href="http://robertlanemusic.blogspot.com/2008/10/terrifying-tour-of-terrible-terror.html">Robert Lane</a><br />
Robert is a musician and on his blog he documents the trials and tribulations of working the West Mids gig circuit.  It&#8217;s well worth a read.  He&#8217;s also a member of a comedy troupe called the new Raving Loonies Stole My Heart.  Their new show, The Terrifying Tour of Terrible Terror calls at the Arena in Wolverhampton on the 30th of October. Swearing and scariness is promised</li>

&#8220;Sikh, Rattle and Roll&#8221;, the short film written and produced by Yugesh Walia at Endboard Productions, and co-financed by Screen WM and Carlton Television won the &#8216;Best Children&#8217;s Film&#8217; Award and a $2500 prize</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/">Flatpack Festival // 11-15 March 2009 &#8211;</a><br />
The newly designed Flatpack Festival site has launched.  There&#8217;s a call for submissions on there <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">but because it&#8217;s one of those slightly infuriating websites that don&#8217;t have distinct pages to link to I can&#8217;t point that out to you. It&#8217;s easy enough to spot though</span> Amateur that I am, I didn&#8217;t spot the permanent links &#8211; <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/submissions">here&#8217;s the submissions one</a> (ta Ian!)</li>
<li><a href="http://photobirmingham.blogspot.com/">PHOTOBIRMINGHAM</a><br />
&#8220;A blog dedicated to creating a photospace in Birmingham and a place to celebrate photography&#8221;. Good to see this up and running. I for one will be watching developments with interest</li>

<p>Twitter is a micro-blogging service.Â  <a href="http://www.doesntcostapenny.com/">Smile</a> is a creative consultancy.Â  Smile don&#8217;t have a blog as such but they have a <a href="http://twitter.com/SmileUpdate">Twitter account</a> and a <a href="http://www.doesntcostapenny.com/">Smile website</a>.Â  They&#8217;re working on the <a href="http://www.baskervilleproject.com/">Baskerville Project</a> (as is <a href="http://blog.alexhughescartoons.co.uk/2008/09/toon-of-baskervilles.html">Alex Hughes</a>, whose well-timed post has just dropped into my RSS reader) and they&#8217;ve put some beautiful photos on their site and Twitterered to tell interested folk like me that they&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite know what they&#8217;re doing but I&#8217;m really interested in seeing the finished product now.</p>
