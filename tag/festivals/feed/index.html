				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t promote your entire programme, promote small batches of events.  By all means have a list of everything that&#8217;s going on (I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s very big and impressive) but don&#8217;t go wave it in peoples&#8217; faces too much.</p>
<p>Not my idea but that of <a href="http://www.thebigdebatebirmingham.co.uk/anthony_rose.htm">Anthony Rose</a> from the BBC.  His point, made at <a href="http://www.thebigdebatebirmingham.co.uk/">The Big Debate</a> yesterday, is that too much choice is stifling.  Applying it to festivals (of which there are <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/05/11/birmingham-summer-festivals-round-up/">many happening/coming up</a> in Birmingham) he said that he loves the idea of them but, faced with an unending list of things to do, he ends up doing nothing.</p>
<p>He suggests festivals break their listings down, perhaps :</p>
<ul>
<li>Just the highlights</li>
<li>Just the free events</li>
<li>Just the weekend events</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on, you get the idea.</p>
<p>He said if you picked out four highlights for him he&#8217;d probably go along.  Give him a list of 50 to pick from and he&#8217;ll just sit at home.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;d probably agree.  Anyone else?  Anyone think it&#8217;s a daft idea?  I&#8217;d be especially interested to hear from anyone involved in festival organisation.</p>
