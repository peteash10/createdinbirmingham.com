				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer brought with it <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/13/birmingham-degree-shows/">degree show time of year</a> and also <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/its-the-first-be-festival-soon/">the first Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> (which I&#8217;m pleased to see will be back again this year). Listings started coming out for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/the-hmv-institute/">the HMV Institute</a> too.</p>
<p>The days were getting longer, which was probably just as well for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/19/rhubarb-collision-hungry/">Rhubarb Rhubarb, who seemed to doing loads</a>. Birmingham presented its <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/city-of-culture-finger-crossing-time/">final bid for the City of Culture</a> and we crossed our fingers. Temper <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/30/cut-from-a-different-cloth/">filled the streets with fashion icons</a>. We looked at the trailer for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/24/soulboy-trailer/">Soulboy</a> and discovered <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/reuben-colley-fine-arts-blog/">the blog for Reuben Colley Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/arts-funding-cuts-in-the-west-midlands/">Arts Council announced a 0.5% cut</a> in funding to RFO&#8217;s. Boo. We found <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/15/synth-eastwood-in-birmingham/">some familiar faces</a> in Synth Eastwood&#8217;s video tomfoolery from the Flatpack Festival. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/14/treasured-a-secret-journey/">Treasured</a> at the MAC looked good.</p>
<p>Bright Space started looking for people to get involved in <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/11/platform-2/">Platform</a> and I asked &#8216;<a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/08/does-birmingham-future-interest-you/">Does Birmingham Future interest you?</a>&#8216; and got a fairly resounding &#8216;Um, who?&#8217;. Theatre folk came together and spoke easy, the newly opened Zellig hosted the Bass Festival&#8217;s <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/04/speakeasy/">Fight The Power exhibition</a> and there was talk of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/verbalise-and-visualise/">verbalising and visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>Creative Republic launched <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/creative-republics-invisible-city-project/">Invisible City</a> and Marketing Birmingham released <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/a-couple-of-videos/">a new promotional video for the city</a> that featured a host of creative talent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cllr Martin Mullaney has <a href="http://martinmullaney.blogspot.com/2010/01/grants-for-new-niche-festivals-in.html">announced the Emerging Festivals Fund</a> &#8211; grants of £500 to £4,999 for new niche festivals. Applications have to be in by 4 February, which seems like incredibly short notice for what this is. <a href="http://birminghamnewsroom.com/?p=6383">More details here</a>.</p>
<p>Might this be useful to the folks at the recent <a href="http://thechallengeofchange.toyoutome.net/detail/an_international_theatre_festival_in_birmingham_for_emerging_companies_and_/">The Challenge of Change</a> event? So what sort of small festivals is the city currently lacking?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably worth seeing this in light of the <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/helpfulthings/neilrami.html">comments from Neil Rami</a> of Marketing Birmingham that I <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/01/07/interview-with-neil-rami/">linked to the other day</a>. When asked which cities have marketed themselves effectively through culture he named Barcelona, Berlin, Glasgow and:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rotterdam, as they have come from nowhere. They have spent eight years capacity building their ability to host festivals and in that time have gone from something like 8 each year to 109. They saw festivals as a way of building a career for an artist and for telling a story. They now import festivals, poaching them from other cities as well as starting their own.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d pull out a quote but I can&#8217;t choose one and, besides, going all soundbitey just isn&#8217;t becoming of an august publication such as this one.</p>
