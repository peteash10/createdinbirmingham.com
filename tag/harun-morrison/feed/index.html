				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This arrived in my inbox a little while ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/fierce.jpg" rel="lightbox[5191]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5192" title="fierce" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/fierce.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="543" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/fierce.jpg 450w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/fierce-248x300.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>Being an obedient sort, I went <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">to the websit</a>e and it seems that, having had a few months to settle into their new roles, Laura and Harun, the new co-artistic directors of <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a> are starting to let their influence hang out.</p>
<p>Their blog&#8217;s up and running and has a few interesting bits n bobs on it already. Harun has compiled a list of <a title="Permanent Link to Thoughts, recollections and impressions of a city new to me" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.wearefierce.org/?p=328">Thoughts, recollections and impressions of a city new to me</a> (well, him) and there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/?p=343">a joint post mulling the role of arts festivals generally</a> which includes this observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>it is increasingly the case that performance and music festivals operate as informal touring circuits; with one successful show passed like a baton from festival to festival. Although this may serve the reputation of a particular show, is this the role of a festival?</p></blockquote>
