&#8220;Two days in a row this week I was asked for recommendations for food things happening in Birmingham […] Here&#8217;s my response&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/dailybulletin/news2/2011/07/27/details-of-new-birmingham-food-festival-unveiled-65233-29129085/">Details of new Birmingham food festival unveiled</a><br />
On the subject of food &#8211; &#8220;The 10-day celebration of food will take place from October 14-23 and replaces the former Taste of Birmingham festival, which was held in the summer&#8221;</li>

An FOI request shows how much the council has spent on celebrity speakers since 2005. I&#8217;m pleased to say that the only one of these that I saw was also the most expensive. Getting value for my council tax, there.</li>

<blockquote><p><em>Pitchfork</em>: Have you ever had any kind of personal interaction with any of the Sabbath people?</p>
<p><em>Dylan Carlson, Earth</em>: No. Sabbath is from Birmingham, England and Tony Iommi supposedly came to a festival we played there once, but I didn&#8217;t actually see him. The two women who put on that festival are always trying to get the Birmingham City Council to recognize that it&#8217;s the city of heavy metal and put up a plaque or a statue to acknowledge it.</p>
<p><em>Pitchfork</em>: That&#8217;s not a bad idea.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A message that went up on <a href="http://www.taktak.net">Tak</a>&#8216;s website last month confirming the news that had been doing the rounds for a little while:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of July 2010 &#8211; exactly six years from the day they opened &#8211; we closed the doors at TAK! Towers to explore new ideas &amp; ventures. It&#8217;s been fun, thanks for having us!</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Tak had been responsible for the <a href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/">Home of Metal</a> website, the branding for <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/">British Dance Edition</a> and had picked up a run of awards for their work on <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/">BMAG&#8217;s Pre-Raphaelite website</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve just heard (<a href="http://twitter.com/animationforum/status/20700382410">via Dave Allen</a>) that <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/">Script</a>, the West Mids agency for dramatic writers, are shutting up shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with great regret and reluctance that the Board of Script has taken the decision to dissolve the company as of the end of August 2010.</p>
<p>The loss of RFO status in March 2008 has had a serious impact on the company&#8217;s resources, and the reliance on ever-decreasing pots of project funding has made its future existence unsustainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/home_news.html">Script&#8217;s August newsletter</a> for further info and to see a slew of opportunities for writers.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In other Midlands metal news, <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/ozzy-osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne is playing an intimate show at Town Hall</a> on 26th June. But I wouldn&#8217;t get your hopes up of catching it Sabbath fans, it&#8217;s already showing up as sold out.</p>

<p>Which sounds fair enough. We&#8217;ve mentioned this one a few times already, but it&#8217;s a good project so what the heck. Go here and get involved:</p>
