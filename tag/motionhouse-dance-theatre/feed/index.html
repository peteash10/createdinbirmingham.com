				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 336px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Kate Chapman &amp; Charlotte Goodwin - Amplifying the Map" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3371/3605031080_4c92e701c6_o.gif" alt="" width="326" height="245" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kate Chapman &amp; Charlotte Goodwin - Amplifying the Map</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to admit to be SUPER excited about the impending re-opening of the mac.  So ANY news, or any work linked to the opening, in turn excites me too.  In addition, my personal interests are deeply rooted in events which involve an element of participation &#8211; and with that in mind, I&#8217;m <em>particularly </em>excited to touch upon &#8216;Site and Sounds&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Site and Sounds offers a taste of the activities planned for mac’s re-opening in 2010 including workshops, walks and the premiere of a specially composed anthem for mac. mac’s Associate Artists <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> and <a href="http://www.motionhouse.co.uk/" target="_blank">Motionhouse Dance Theatre</a> will also be presenting work as part of the summer programme including an adventure in the dark and some in-your-face dancing.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a substantial programme of events leading up to the re-opening &#8211; details of which can be found on the <a href="http://macartists.co.uk/home.html" target="_blank">macartists</a> website, as well as information on how to book for workshop places.  I was excited to see a <a href="http://macartists.co.uk/events-menu/11-1st-august-2-5pm-time-and-place-screen-printing-workshop.html" target="_blank">screen-printing workshop</a> advertised, then realised I am sadly 16 years too old to take part. Sniffle.  If you DO fit into that age category however, I think it&#8217;ll be a lot of fun!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m also curious about the recent theme of &#8216;mapping&#8217; which keeps cropping up in projects and artist&#8217;s works of late.  This time, artists Kate Chapman and Charlotte Goodwin are exploring the mapping theme by inviting people who live, work or play close to mac to re-discover familiar places and explore places they have never visited before, sharing their thoughts and observations to create an audio map of the changing landscape.  All of these recordings will feed into an audio map – a web of downloadable audio tracks focusing on different locations in a mile radius of Cannon Hill Park.  I&#8217;m wondering if any CiB readers have experienced any other map-themed artworks/projects of late &#8211; if so, send me an email or leave a comment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will also be interested to see &#8216;Underground&#8217;,  performed by four dancers from <a href="http://www.motionhouse.co.uk/" target="_blank">Motionhouse Dance Theatre</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Set within a rocking tubular structure, using physical dance, poignant imagery and surprising aerial encounters, &#8216;Underground&#8217;, explores the reality of train travel.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the title of the performance, I imagine it would originally by inspired by the experience of underground travel as opposed to regular trains.  How this will translate both to regular train travel as well as the open space of Cannon Hill Park will remain a mystery until the performance itself, which is happening Saturday 18th July at Cannon Hill Park at 11.30am, 1pm and 3pm.</p>
