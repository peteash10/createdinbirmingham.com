<p>Over the past few months a group of people have been taking part in MOB:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MOB</strong> is a project inspired by the current craze of ‘flash mobbing’ where seemingly unplanned ‘happenings’ take place involving hundreds of children, young people and adults. MOB is about creating new ‘disturbances’ that help share the values of the Olympics &amp; Paralympics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among various other things (the full list is actually pretty exhausting), they&#8217;ve performed at Prince Albert School, spent a day with <a href="http://www.firstlightonline.co.uk/movies/#birmingham-will-mob-you">First Light Movies</a>, did a photoshoot with <a href="http://www.adrian-burrows.co.uk/">Adrian Burrows</a> and rode a red bus around the city doing good deeds.</p>
<p>All of the activity has been <a href="http://mobbirmingham.tumblr.com/archive">collected together on this Tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>The final part of the project is an exhibition that&#8217;ll be launched at <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/">The Drum</a> on Monday 18 April at 6.30pm.</p>

Can anyone help Stereographic out?  They need:<br />
(1) a mannequin â€“ full sized / male or female. (If by any chance anyone has a reflective mannequin that would be a mega bonus!)<br />
(2) any â€˜discarded designâ€™ fellow designers / artists / companies have that they want to get rid of â€“ things like demo prints / failed pitch designs / overruns on brochures etc</li>

<p>What I wrote the other day about <a href="http://www.fluidesign.co.uk/">Fluid Design</a> flying slightly above my radar probably applies just as much to <a href="http://www.firstlightmovies.com/">First Light Movies</a> who do some fantastic work, but often on a national, rather than local scale.</p>
<p>They describe themselves thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>First Light Movies funds and inspires film projects with five to 19-year-olds throughout the UK.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2001, we have enabled over 12,000 budding young filmmakersÂ to write, act, shoot, light, direct and produce over 800 films. Working with filmmakers and organisations, First Light Movies films coverÂ a diverse rangeÂ ofÂ topics and genres, and make use of accessible digital film technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>With all the good stuff they&#8217;re doing, I was pleased to see that they&#8217;ve started a <a href="http://firstlightmovies.blogspot.com/">First Light Movies blog</a>. Perhaps that&#8217;ll help me keep up with them.</p>
<p>I had a chat with Gary from First Light at the <a href="http://www.podnosh.com/blog/2008/10/15/bad08-birmingham-social-media-surgery-provisional-results/">Birmingham Social Media Surgery</a> last night and he seems keen to experiment with the format in their work and see how best to use it &#8211; perhaps showcasing the work they do, promoting their own (and, just as importantly, others) events/projects and all sorts of other things to boot.Â  Good to see.</p>
