				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk" target="_blank">REP</a> have commissioned a play entitled <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/these-four-streets" target="_blank">These Four Streets</a> inspired by the stories of local people who were connected to or affected by the Lozells disturbances of October 2005, where the rumour of a rape sparked disorder leading to a man’s death, widespread damage and a fracture between two communities.</p>

<p>These Four Streets tells the stories of over 30 characters living and working in an inner city area. It is a collaboration between six young female writers, inspired by their own meetings and interviews with dozens of local people. The production explores the power of rumour and what it feels like to live in a place that everybody else has given up on.</p>
<p>I was really impressed with the REP website which allows visitors to comment on the production information, giving people a platform to tell their own experiences and opinions.</p>
<p class="lightGrey largeType whiteBG left">These Four Streets runs Thu 12 Feb 2009 &#8211; Sat 28 Feb 2009 and will tour regionally.<abbr class="dtstart" title="2009-02-12T19:00"><abbr class="dtend" title="2009-02-28T19:00"></p>
