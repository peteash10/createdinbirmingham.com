				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are a few trailers that have made it onto my &#8216;to blog&#8217; list recently.</p>
<p>First up, a trailer for the upcoming performance of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Td2DvHFhmU">the Mozart Requiem by Notorious</a>:</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="305" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4Td2DvHFhmU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://clareedwards.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/notorious-does-the-mozart-requiem/">Clare Edwards has blogged some info about this</a>.</p>
<p>Next is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&#038;v=STzFEvhauRM">the trailer for The Last Projectionist</a>:</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="335" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/STzFEvhauRM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard of <a href="http://www.thelastprojectionist.co.uk/" title="The Last Projectionist">The Last Projectionist</a> before but somehow hadn&#8217;t twigged what it was about:</p>
<blockquote><p>The story centres on The Electric in Birmingham, the oldest working cinema in Britian. From its silent beginnings in 1909; to a news and cartoon cinema during WWII; a porn cinema in the 70s &#038; 80s; then saved from demolition and restored to its art deco glory in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="http://vimeo.com/12208756" title="King Adora documentary trailer">the trailer for a soon-to-be-released documentary about King Adora</a>:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/12208756?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="601" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>I met Ben Lewis (who was also involved in The Last Projectionist) from <a href="http://www.siwelproductions.co.uk/" title="Siwel Productions">Siwel Productions</a> last week and he emailed me some more info about this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d wanted to make a documentary for a while and although my close friend was in the band I&#8217;d never really explored what that experience was like for him. We got talking and I&#8217;d decided that I&#8217;d like to produce a film about not only King Adora but what its like being in a band, any band, the music business at that time ( pre social media boom) , and nature of creativity etc </p>
<p>Self funded and calling in favours from friends in the industry the project grew and various characters that had featured in the bands timeline began to show interest. Steve Lamacq gave a great interview as did John Cornfield, the producer of their first album.</p>
<p>We managed to get into the jug of ale pub in Moseley ( now being converted ) as it very much was a part of the band and many other bands history. </p>
<p>The band reformed in 2010 for two shows at the Hare and Hounds and the Garage in Islington. It was great to interview the fans, some from way back and new fans that had found the band via you tube and facebook etc</p>
<p>I was always conscious that I didn&#8217;t want to adhere to a narrative in which band get signed, band break up, band reform etc </p>
<p>The film runs parallel narratives that explore the relationships witihin the band, what there up to now and how the &#8220;ride&#8221; effected them.</p></blockquote>
