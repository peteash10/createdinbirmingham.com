				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from Alex&#8217;s post about <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/02/21/ikon-eastside-closure/">Ikon Eastside closing</a>, let me pile on the joy by presenting a few other things that aren&#8217;t going to be around so much.</p>
<p><strong>Birmingham City Council</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/02/18/320m-cuts-will-dismantle-the-structure-of-birmingham-city-council-65233-28194400/">At least not as we know it</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More Canals Than Venice</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/pixiesixer">Annabel</a> has said that, needing to prioritise paying work, she&#8217;s <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/the-end-of-a-chapter">changing her approach to running the site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I intend to discover the new in the city, but at a more leisurely pace and in more depth</p></blockquote>
<p>Which doesn&#8217;t sound all that bad really.</p>
<p><strong>The Yam Yam</strong></p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.theyamyam.com/the-yamyam%E2%80%99s-gooin%E2%80%99-away%E2%80%A6">The Yam Yam</a>, a Walsall-based aggregator of local news, is shutting up shop completely. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theyamyam.com/the-yamyam-reasons-to-be-cheerful">a fuller explanation of what that&#8217;s all about</a>. I was aware of the site but, not living in Walsall, had no particular reason for following it very closely &#8211; the number and content of the comments tell you how much the site was appreciated though.</p>
<p><strong>Next?</strong></p>
<p>In a few weeks time we&#8217;re going to hear about which of the established arts organisations and council services aren&#8217;t going to be supported any more. That&#8217;s not going to be pleasant. There&#8217;ll still be plenty of good stuff for us to write about on CiB, and plenty of individuals doing good things, but we won&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re missing.</p>
<p>On the web side of things, it&#8217;s worth remembering that most of the genuinely interesting websites around are actually quite fragile things and, if they&#8217;re run for personal enjoyment, it&#8217;s probably best not to assume they&#8217;ll be around forever either. See also <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2011/01/brummie-of-the-year-2010.html">Jon Bounds&#8217; comments</a> last month when the harmless bit of fun that was Brummie of the Year turned nasty on BiNS:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll continue to ruminate as to whether the site does its job or is best closed.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m all for a bit of a shake-up, some new voices and some new ways of doing things. We&#8217;ll see how things pan out over the next little while.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>I forgot to end this post with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR6yZqMju_k">some bunnies</a>:</p>
