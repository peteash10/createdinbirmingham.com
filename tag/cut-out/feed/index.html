				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/01/19/charity-idea-help-needed-please/" target="_blank">set out an idea</a> for a CiB charity project involving a design competition resulting in the production of a limited edition CiB t-shirt which will raise money for a Birmingham based charity. Now, two weeks on, I have done a bit of research, taken on-board all of your suggestions and found lots of helpful people who would like to get involved.</p>
<p>We have decided to money raised will go to a popular choice for a Birmingham based charity: <a href="http://www.acorns.org.uk/" target="_blank">Acorns Children&#8217;s  Hospice.</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3047" title="ciblabel3" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ciblabel3.jpg" alt="ciblabel3" width="425" height="262" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ciblabel3.jpg 425w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ciblabel3-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p>This is the first call for submissions and here is how it will work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can submit a design entry to the competition, as long as you follow the specifications needed for printing.</li>
<li>From the entries 20 final designs will be chosen and made into 50 limited edition pin badge sets.</li>
<li>One final design will be chosen and will be made into 50 limited edition t-shirts and 50 limited edition canvas bags.</li>
<li>All items will be lovingly screenprinted by hand and sold online by <a href="http://cutoutshop.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Cut &#8211; Out</a>, a fantasic DIY print company based in the West Midlands. All items will be printed with eco friendly inks and on top quality <a href="http://www.earthpositiveonline.com/" target="_blank">Earth Positive</a> apparel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The brief:</strong></p>
<p>We want to make a t-shirt that people will really want to wear, so the brief is very loose. The emphasis here is celebrating creative talent in Birmingham and raising some money in the process. You could design something which reflects the creativity of the city, or just your own style, it&#8217;s up to you!</p>
<p><strong>Submission guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The design should work using one colour, if the image is a photograph it needs to be converted to half tone.</li>
<li>The design you submit needs to be 300 dpi (usual print quality).</li>
<li>The design should be no bigger than A3 in size.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deadline: Friday 6th March 5pm.</strong> Send your design as a PDF or JPG file to Createdinbirmingham[at]gmail.com, and hang on to your originals.</p>

Not quite sure what the deal is with this one. They&#8217;ve got a DIY print studio and are looking for people to submit designs for them to use on T-shirts and so on. A physical shop is apparently coming in summer 09, in the meantime they&#8217;re up online with a website (coming soon) and this blog</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamusic.com/newsdetails.php?news_id=772">Birmingham Music</a><br />
&#8220;The Town Hall and Symphony Hall website have launched a new online booking system for their events&#8230;  Also, as an introductory offer, you can take advantage of free postage on all bookings up to November 30th&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dg7qn7h5_0hph5j5hg">Draft Vision for a Birmingham Photospace</a><br />
The next meeting about this is on Tues 14 October at 6.30pm in the Library cafe, Birmingham city centre.  Seek out the Birmingham Flickr group for how the discussion about this is going; this is a link to the draft vision they&#8217;ve prepared</li>
<li><a href="http://flipfestivalblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/grads-on-walls-event/">Flip Blog &#8211; Grads On Walls Event</a><br />
The Flip Animation folk put out a reminder for the Animation Forum WM&#8217;s Grads on Walls event on Monday (good to see people talking up other people&#8217;s events &#8211; a very smart thing to do, I&#8217;d say)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stylebirmingham.com/style-news/birminghams-most-stylish">Birminghams Most Stylish &#8211; Style Birmingham</a><br />
&#8220;The 500 people who have made it through this year&#8217;s Style Search will be whittled down to just ten this weekend at a special party at Gatecrasher&#8221;.  Why am I linking to this? Um&#8230; just spreading the joy I guess</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/screen.html">Script screenwriting course</a><br />
&#8220;Script, in association with Outside Centre, presents an in-depth Introduction to Screenwriting Course&#8221; at Wolverhampton&#8217;s Light House</li>

Is it me or does the text in the link make no sense. Basically, Fazeley Studios has been chosen as the venue for the 2008 Plus Design Festival. Shame on me for not spotting that they had a blog though, and thanks to Nicky at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2008/10/links-for-october-10th-which-includes-a-slight-rant/">Digbeth is Good</a> for pointing it out</li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=28040414727&amp;ref=nf">Facebook group &#8211; mid*point</a><br />
&#8220;mid*point is the network for independent theatre companies in the West Midlands&#8221; There doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any activity on the website for over a year but they&#8217;ve just started a Facebook group so something must be going on under the hood</li>
