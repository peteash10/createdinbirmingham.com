<p>Digbeth based <a href="http://www.yamination.com/">Yamination Studios</a> have launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">kickstarter</a> to help them reach completion of their new animation &#8216;At-issue&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yamination is the hub of multi-award winning stop-motion/frame animator, Drew Roper.<i> ‘At-issue’</i> is his brand new short film about Bartholomew, an unemployed lovable puppet, and his audition for the dream job – acting. But when a bizarre affliction strikes, he grasps that unless he can learn to be himself, his dream won’t be realised.</p>
<p>Falling short of your own expectations and never giving up on your dreams is something everyone can relate to; this film gives a light hearted spin on that and some of the cultural issues facing Britain today. Bartholomew’s situation is one that many people face, so we are demonstrating that there is hope if you keep the faith, the persistence and the determination.</p>
<p><b>We are currently mid-way through production, but you can help us reach the finish line by pledging absolutely anything you can to help us finish the film. Please share the page and spread the word!</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Yamination Studios (<em>which is a mixture of yam-yam and animation nonetheless</em>) have a comprehensive list of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">kickstarter backer rewards</a> in return for helping to push them towards the finish line of their mission.</p>
<p>You can opt for various downloads, a signed DVD of the final film, A3/A1 prints, and even character drawings through to studio experiences; including animation workshops/masterclasses with skilled professionals (<em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em> and <em>Frankenweenie</em> Art Department Model Maker <strong>Yossel Simpson Little </strong>and<strong> </strong><em>Shaun the Sheep</em>, <em>Creature Comforts</em>, <em>Rastamouse</em> and Tim Burton&#8217;s <em>A Corpse Bride</em> character animator <strong>Tim Allen</strong>)<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">amongst other fantastic rewards</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about their intentions with the money (&#8220;not to be spent on beer&#8221;) and the full rewards list <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">on the kickstarter page too</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck Drew &amp; team!</p>
