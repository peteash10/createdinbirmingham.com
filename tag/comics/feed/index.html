				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I try to keep up with what great projects the Midlands arm of <a href="http://www.hi8us.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hi8us</a> are up to. For last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hellodigital.net/" target="_blank">Hello Digital</a> event they worked with a group of older people to enable them to tell their stories through digital media. Hi8us are a great resource for the Midlands and their projects, whilst being aimed at hard-to-reach young people, older people and those with physical and mental disabilities, they do it without being po-faced and by getting involved in modern and relevant media.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3635" title="comix_spidey" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/comix_spidey.jpg" alt="comix_spidey" width="525" height="293" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/comix_spidey.jpg 525w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/comix_spidey-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /><em><span style="color: #808080;">Spiderman, drawn by John McCrea</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest scheme is a continuation of their work with comics, or should I say Comix.To take part in this new scheme you need to be over the age of 16 (which isn&#8217;t hard, lets face it) with a passion for comic art and live in the West Midlands. The lucky chosen few will also get to work with people on similar schemes across Europe and get a supported trip to a comic art festival in Spain, as well as a trip to the Birmingham&#8217;s International Comics Show.</p>
<p>20 talented individuals will get the opportunity to develop their skills with John McCrea (X-Men, Spiderman and The Hulk), Hunt Emerson (The Beano, Wall Street Journal and Fortean Times), Laura Howell (The Beano, The Guardian), and Andi Watson (Geisha, Buffy) amongst others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Interested? Pop onto the <a href="http://www.hi8us.co.uk" target="_blank">Hi8us website</a>.</em></p>
