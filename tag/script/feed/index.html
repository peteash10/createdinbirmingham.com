				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A message that went up on <a href="http://www.taktak.net">Tak</a>&#8216;s website last month confirming the news that had been doing the rounds for a little while:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of July 2010 &#8211; exactly six years from the day they opened &#8211; we closed the doors at TAK! Towers to explore new ideas &amp; ventures. It&#8217;s been fun, thanks for having us!</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Tak had been responsible for the <a href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/">Home of Metal</a> website, the branding for <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/">British Dance Edition</a> and had picked up a run of awards for their work on <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/">BMAG&#8217;s Pre-Raphaelite website</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve just heard (<a href="http://twitter.com/animationforum/status/20700382410">via Dave Allen</a>) that <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/">Script</a>, the West Mids agency for dramatic writers, are shutting up shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with great regret and reluctance that the Board of Script has taken the decision to dissolve the company as of the end of August 2010.</p>
<p>The loss of RFO status in March 2008 has had a serious impact on the company&#8217;s resources, and the reliance on ever-decreasing pots of project funding has made its future existence unsustainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/home_news.html">Script&#8217;s August newsletter</a> for further info and to see a slew of opportunities for writers.</p>

Not quite sure what the deal is with this one. They&#8217;ve got a DIY print studio and are looking for people to submit designs for them to use on T-shirts and so on. A physical shop is apparently coming in summer 09, in the meantime they&#8217;re up online with a website (coming soon) and this blog</li>

The next meeting about this is on Tues 14 October at 6.30pm in the Library cafe, Birmingham city centre.  Seek out the Birmingham Flickr group for how the discussion about this is going; this is a link to the draft vision they&#8217;ve prepared</li>

The Flip Animation folk put out a reminder for the Animation Forum WM&#8217;s Grads on Walls event on Monday (good to see people talking up other people&#8217;s events &#8211; a very smart thing to do, I&#8217;d say)</li>

&#8220;The 500 people who have made it through this year&#8217;s Style Search will be whittled down to just ten this weekend at a special party at Gatecrasher&#8221;.  Why am I linking to this? Um&#8230; just spreading the joy I guess</li>

Is it me or does the text in the link make no sense. Basically, Fazeley Studios has been chosen as the venue for the 2008 Plus Design Festival. Shame on me for not spotting that they had a blog though, and thanks to Nicky at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2008/10/links-for-october-10th-which-includes-a-slight-rant/">Digbeth is Good</a> for pointing it out</li>

&#8220;mid*point is the network for independent theatre companies in the West Midlands&#8221; There doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any activity on the website for over a year but they&#8217;ve just started a Facebook group so something must be going on under the hood</li>
