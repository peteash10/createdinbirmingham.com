				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kinda charming this is:</p>
<blockquote><p>From 12 &#8211; 30 August, Ikon is running a tailor shop in the old Salvation Army charity shop, 3 New Street, Erdington.Â  Led by creative facilitator Jess Worley and local members of the <a href="http://erdoarts.blogspot.com/">Erdington Arts Forum</a>, the shop will be making small fabric whales designed by pupils from Erdington Hall Primary School</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s to tie in with <a href="http://www.domusweb.it/domus2k6/source/contents/item.cfm?type=NWS&amp;ID=132735&amp;lingua=_eng">Claudia Losi&#8217;s Balenaproject</a> &#8211; the installation of a lifesize cashmere whale at the Ikon gallery in September (obviously&#8230;).Â  Rather than something that big, the tailor shop will produce 85 of the smaller whales.</p>
<p>If you can sew, have at least eight days to commit and would like to get involved with the project then give Claire (Ikon&#8217;s Education Curator) a call on 0121 248 0708.</p>

<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of the Ikon, the gallery is still opening til 8pm on Wednesdays until 10 September and the guests for the remaining &#8216;<a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/214/late_night_opening_events/">These are a few of my favourite things</a>&#8216; are:</p>
