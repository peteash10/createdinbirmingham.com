				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just had an email from a journalist writing an article on art in Birmingham.Â  She says:</p>
<blockquote><p>While I will be looking at galleries such as RBSA and Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery I would also like to look at something less conventional such as street art and something with a more independent edge</p></blockquote>
<p>The first few things that sprung to mind (thinking mainly of galleries) were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/">Ikon Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eastsideprojects.org/">Eastside Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/the-edge/">The Edge</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.urbanartbar.com/">Urban Art Bar</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?sid=a4d3b6d6c1fba222e69567a817fce395&amp;refurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fs.php%3Finit%3Dq%26q%3Dgallery%2Bof%2Bowls%26ref%3Dts%26sid%3Da4d3b6d6c1fba222e69567a817fce395&amp;eid=48773196528">Gallery of Owls</a> (although I&#8217;ve not visited and am struggling to find out much about this place)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.purplegallery.com/">Purple Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hedz.ltd.uk/">Hedz</a> (for street art stuff)</li>
</ul>
<p>What have I missed?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was leaving the Electric yesterday having seen the excellent <a href="http://www.planetbboy.com/">Planet B-Boy</a> I was handed a  brochure for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bassfestival.co.uk/">BASS Festival</a>, happening across the East Midlands over June.</p>
<p>BASS stands for British Art and Street Sounds and the festival is a <a href="http://www.punch-records.co.uk/">Punch Records</a> production in partnership with 2Funky Arts, Hella Music and Baby J Studios.  This year the festival revolves around the theme of &#8216;The Elements of Hip Hop&#8217;, usually broken down into MCing, DJing, graffiti, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUo1TewFePY">breakdancing</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB46rT2Nz1E&amp;feature=related">beat-boxing</a>.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.bassfestival.co.uk/">BASS Festival</a> for the full line-up, but here&#8217;s a few of the events in Birmingham:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hedz Interative Aerosol Mural, 31 May to 1 June &#8211; creating a 50ft bespoke aerosol mural in the city centre</li>
<li>Urban Disturbance v MyBass ft Mary Anne Hobbs, 31 May at The Rainbow &#8211; drum n bass and dubstep heaviness</li>
<li>Faith 47 &#8211; The Restless Debt of Third World Beauty, 3 to 10 June at Womb Gallery &#8211; this looks very good</li>
<li>BASS West Mids Launch &#8211; 3 June</li>
<li>The New Mastersounds, 14 June at The Yardbird &#8211; a band at the forefront of the retro-funk sound</li>
<li>My Love for Hip Hop, 19 June at The Drum &#8211; powerful spoken word with 3 poets, 3 hip hop artists and a turntablist</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, this is daft, there&#8217;s loads of good stuff so please go and have a look at <a href="http://www.bassfestival.co.uk/">the listings</a> and maybe flag up anything you think looks really interesting in the comments.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that Jessica is currently doing a work placement at Punch and <a href="http://jess-lauren.blogspot.com/">blogging about her experiences</a>.</p>

He&#8217;s emailed to say that his dad was annoyed at not having tea with the Queen!  Ammo&#8217;s sent over a pic of his dad with some beefeaters though &#8211; nice shoes.</p>
