<p>The writer will be expected to produce three pieces of critical writing (as detailed below), which will be published on <a href="http://www.thisistomorrow.info/" target="_blank">www.thisistomorrow.info</a> and <a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/" target="_blank">www.weareeastside.com</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A review of Flatpack or Fierce Festival (500words), March 2011</li>
