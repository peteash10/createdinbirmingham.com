				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Erdington, Perry Barr, Hodge Hill and Ladywood are among the areas that don&#8217;t get enough of a look-in on this blog so it was nice to pick up some blurb about a project called <a href="http://brumpr.posterous.com/local-people-showcase-their-artistic-talent-i">In Our Backyard</a> which put artists in those areas over a year. The work produced will be at The Community gallery at <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">BMAG</a> from 10 April (not that I can find any info on their website, but that&#8217;s nothing new).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Islamic_Mosaic.jpg" rel="lightbox[5361]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5362" title="Islamic_Mosaic" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Islamic_Mosaic.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="492" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Islamic_Mosaic.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Islamic_Mosaic-300x295.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The artists who took part were <a href="http://mohsenkeiany.com/">Mohsen Keiany</a> &#8211; an internationally-recognised painter and illustrator; video and film makers <a href="http://www.reelaccess.org.uk/">Reel Access</a> (George Fleming and Laura Breakwell); <a href="http://artsresidencies.org/eleanorhoad/">Eleanor Hoad</a> &#8211; a cultural eco-artist with a keen interest in permaculture and issues of sustainability and storytellers <a href="http://www.annamation.co.uk/">Annamation</a> (Anna Conomos and Susanna Willetts).</p>
<p>Works produced by the artists and local communities include a large  scale mosaic based on by Islamic calligraphy, created by family groups in Ladywood; a filming and photography project made by under 5s and their parents showing community perspectives of Hodge Hill; the planting of fruit trees in Erdington High Street town centre arcade and creation of a map of fruit trees in the area &#8211; and a story telling project in Perry Barr, which worked with community elders to hear their tales and then helped young people to learn and re-tell them.</p></blockquote>
