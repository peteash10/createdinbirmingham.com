				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been forwarded the following which has been written by Anita Bhalla, chair of mac&#8217;s board of trustees. As it&#8217;s an open letter I figure there&#8217;s no problem with me reproducing it in full. Excuse me for dispensing with the usual blockquote rigmarole.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Dear Friends, Colleagues and Supporters,</p>
<p>As you may be aware, Birmingham City Council has recently launched a public consultation process on its budget plans from April 2012 onwards, and we thought it would be of interest to you as a customer and supporter of <strong>mac birmingham</strong> to hear how the city’s plans are affecting our work.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong> reopened in May 2010 after a £15.2m redevelopment and refurbishment. Birmingham City Council played a major role in the development providing £6.7m of investment and delivering the project under their Partnering Framework with Thomas Vale Construction, one of the region’s award winning construction companies. The rest of the funding came from Arts Council England (£6.2m) and from a highly successful fund-raising appeal with donations from companies, individuals and grant-making trusts (£2.3m). Over 850,000 visits were made to “new” <strong>mac</strong> in its first year after reopening.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>’s finances are finely balanced in a mixed economy; in our second year since reopening 26% of our turnover is investment from the City Council. Since our much lauded reopening year our business confidence is established and a growing percentage of our income is earned from box-office, sponsorship and other commercial activities.</p>
<p>As part of its response to the government’s public spending cuts, the City Council has already substantially reduced the amount of funding it gives to all the arts organisations in the city and in April this year <strong>mac birmingham</strong>’s grant was cut by 14%, a cash reduction of £107,000 per annum.</p>
<p>To cope with this significant reduction in income we have driven further the plans which were developed prior to reopening, maximising efficiency, amending our programming plans and increasing our efforts to maximise all other income streams. Throughout the planning and delivery of the <strong>mac/sampad</strong> Building Project we sought to maximise future efficiency through, for example, creating a flexible staffing structure, delivering a cost-efficient building with an effective building management system, reducing our carbon footprint and our running costs, increasing recycling, using digital technology to manage our building and our communications. Our shared office space has also allowed us provide improved facilities for our partners <strong>sampad</strong> and for other artists, arts companies and community agencies who share the <strong>mac</strong> creative hub.</p>
<p>Whilst we fully recognise that we cannot be exempt from the public spending cuts being imposed at the moment, there are few options available for further reducing costs without severely damaging our services. Whilst we continue to look for greater efficiencies and sharing of services we do fear that any further cuts in BCC funding will lead to a serious “downward spiral” in which the inevitable reductions in artistic activity will lead to lower earned income and funding. Further investment secured from additional sources may well then be withdrawn due to our diminished capacity to deliver our agreed programme.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Birmingham’s arts infrastructure and activities have, for so long, been a vital tool in the city’s aim to improve the quality of life for its citizens, its inward investment performance and its status as a true global city. Evidence of the hugely beneficial impact of the creative industries can be found at <a href="http://t.ymlp242.net/emearauhymacaueeacaumjbq/click.php" target="_blank">www.birminghamartspartnership.<wbr />co.uk</a></p>
<p>City based cultural organisations contribute £271m to the region’s economy per year. This is generated from almost 2 million attendances, with arts attenders generating £40m in Additional Visitor Spend (AVS). This represents a return on investment of £29 for every £1 that Birmingham City Council spends on funding the arts.</p>
<p>All of the city’s arts organisations believe that we are now at the tipping point where incremental reductions in costs are no longer achievable.</p>
<p>If you share our concerns and would not want to see the City Council reduce its funding to the independent arts organisations any further, I would urge you to make your views known to the City Council <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">before the end of November</span></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>By filling out an online survey at  <a href="http://t.ymlp242.net/emmacauhymaoaueeaiaumjbq/click.php" target="_blank">www.birmingham.gov.uk/<wbr />budgetviews</a></li>
<li>By emailing to <a href="mailto:budget_views@birmingham.gov.uk" target="_blank">budget_views@birmingham.gov.uk</a></li>
<li>By text message to: 07786 200 403</li>
<li>By writing to Budget Views, Room B119, The Council House, Victoria Square, Birmingham, B1 1BB</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have received a similar plea from other arts organisations and we would urge you to respond to any one of us. Representation needs to be made before the end of November in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and for your continuing support of <strong>mac birmingham</strong>.</p>
<p>Anita Bhalla<br />
Chair of <strong>mac</strong> Board of Trustees</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday lunchtime I went along to the launch of <a title="IDFB" href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/">International Dance Festival Birmingham 2012</a>. For the uninitiated, IDFB is a <em>massive</em> festival of dance organised by <a href="http://www.dancexchange.org.uk/">Dancexchange</a> and the <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/">Hippodrome</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good round-up of what&#8217;s being planned over on <a title="West Midlands Dance" href="http://westmidlandsdance.com/2011/11/17/international-dance-festival-birmingham-2012-launches">West Midlands Dance</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11093" title="IDFB 2012" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IDFB-2012.png" alt="IDFB 2012" width="596" height="134" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IDFB-2012.png 596w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IDFB-2012-300x67.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of good stuff lined up, but the bits that made me nudge the person next to me and go &#8216;huh, that&#8217;ll be interesting&#8217; were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wings of Desire (the big dance spectacular in Victoria Sq), with <a href="http://www.circa.org.au/">Circa</a> and <a href="http://www.2faceddance.co.uk/">2FaCeD DaNcE Company</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/un-peu-de-tendresse-bordel-de-merde">Dave St-Pierre Company &#8211; Un peu de tendresse bordel de merde!</a> (which generated a tonne of controversy in London a couple of months ago)</li>
</ul>
<p>I like IDFB. It was probably the first one, back in 2008, that got me interested in dance in the first place. I then worked on the 2010 festival and managed to pack in 18 shows over the course of its month-long run. This one looks like being another good one.</p>

<blockquote><p>MANDALA is a unique and bold new collaboration fusing classical and contemporary South Asian dance and music with 3D architectural projection mapping.</p>
<p>We plan to use one of the world’s most advanced real-time tracking systems to use the movement of the dancers, musicians and the audience to generate the imagery live, enabling you to push, pull and manipulate the building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which sounds pretty impressive to me. They&#8217;re co-producing this with <a title="Seeper" href="http://seeper.com/">Seeper</a> who are responsible for some of the most impressive projection mapping I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re <a title="Wefund - Mandala" href="http://www.wefund.com/project/mandala">using Wefund to collect donations</a> for the £5,000 required to make this happen. Donations are welcome and here&#8217;s a video explaining the project a bit more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://biteback.org.uk/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9376" title="Biting Back" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Biting-Back.jpg" alt="Biting Back" width="500" height="250" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Biting-Back.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Biting-Back-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s the last day for picking up <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/event/bcc-conference">discounted early bird tickets for Biting Back</a>, taking place on 21 March:</p>
<blockquote><p>a one day event from Birmingham City Council, mac and Sampad that will address how arts sector professionals and individual artists can learn from examples of successful partnerships in austere cultural landscapes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tickets will still be available, they&#8217;ll just be more expensive and saving money is the name of the game here. With less cash around to make things happen over the coming years, the idea is to hear from people (some from Birmingham, some from much further away) with practical experience of interesting partnerships and different ways of working.</p>
<p><a href="http://biteback.org.uk/the-event/symposium-schedule/">The schedule for the day</a> is here. I&#8217;ll be there talking about what we did with the Created in Birmingham Shop last year. <a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/">Friction Arts</a>, <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>, the <a href="http://www.theflyovershow.com/">Flyover Show</a>, <a href="http://latabacalera.net/">La Tabacalera</a>, <a href="http://www.mirfestival.gr/el/">MIR Festival</a> and more will feature too.</p>
<p>Biting Back is also on <a href="http://twitter.com/artsbiteback">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Biting-Back/190750350956563">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/biting-back/">Lanyrd</a>.</p>
