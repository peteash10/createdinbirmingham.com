				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in Coventry at the <a href="http://www.coventry.ac.uk/researchnet/d/299">Institute for Creative Enterprise</a> (home to companies like <a href="http://www.imagineerproductions.co.uk/">Imagineer Productions</a>, amongst others) when I spotted the <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/pledge.shtml">Stan&#8217;s Cafe theatre pledge cards</a> sitting in a tidy pile on the reception desk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/theatre-pledges1.jpg" rel="lightbox[5025]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5029" title="theatre pledges" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/theatre-pledges1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/theatre-pledges1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/theatre-pledges1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The process by which they came to be there is quite compelling and seems to have gone something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attend talky get-together</li>
<li>Have idea</li>
<li>Take action</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether they achieve their stated aim or not doesn&#8217;t matter. If nothing else they stand as evidence that 2 (coming out of 1) can lead to 3.</p>
<p>Tangent &#8211; this reminds me of the bit in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X">Scott McCloud&#8217;s utterly excellent Understanding Comics</a> that talks about the action all happening between the panels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only had a glance through the discussions and the proposals put forward but the <a href="http://thechallengeofchange.toyoutome.net/detail/an_international_theatre_festival_in_birmingham_for_emerging_companies_and_/">Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> sounds interesting. A lot of discussions seem to feature the question &#8216;Do we need an equivalent of <a href="http://theatrebristol.net/">Theatre Bristol</a>?&#8217; (which could be very nice) but, as I said before, I think the idea of everyone taking <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=435">The Pledges</a> is a good starter, mainly because it depends on no-one else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks back there was <a href="http://scriptwm.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/the-challenge-of-change-how-can-we-create-a-better-future-for-theatre-here-in-the-west-midlands/">a meet-up of West Mids theatre folk</a> &#8211; the event was called The Challenge of Change and (from what I understand) there were two days of workshops and discussions  around the future of West Mids theatre.</p>
<p>Graeme Rose (<a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/toyorch">The Modified Toy Orchestra</a>, etc) has written up some <a href="http://graemerose.com/2009/11/27/the-challenge-of-change/">notes about the first day</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s talk of Action Plans coming out of the event but I&#8217;m yet to find anything online anywhere just yet. Until they turn up, I rather like this list of pledges sketched out by James Yarker (also of Stan&#8217;s Cafe):</p>
<ol>
<li>Attend 12 theatre shows in the next 12 months, 4 by West Midlands writers/artists/companies you haven’t seen before, 1 in a West Midlands Venue you’ve never been to before.</li>
<li>Take 12 people who have never been, rarely go, or don’t ‘do’ Independent Theatre to a show. Share transport.</li>
<li>Host a meal/party for 8 people 4 of which you barely know.</li>
<li>Write 12 comments/reviews/blog entries about theatre on other people’s sites.</li>
<li>Attend 1 mid*point or return to the next Open Space event.</li>
</ol>
<p>They seem like common sense things that you&#8217;d hope people would be doing anyway but probably aren&#8217;t by everyone. I&#8217;m sure very similar things could be drawn up for many different artforms. <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=435">James explains</a> where the pledges came from. It&#8217;d be nice if they really were written up in some formal way. <a href="http://yascapi.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/taking-the-pledge/">Michelle Knight</a> has opted in. Is anyone else prepared to be held to these? If not, how come?</p>
