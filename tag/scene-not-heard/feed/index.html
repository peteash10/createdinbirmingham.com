				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capsule started a ball rolling the other week, <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/2010/01/28/engaging-regional-audiences-how-do-we-do-it/">talking about how to engage regional audiences</a>. There&#8217;s a good discussion in the comments that&#8217;s worth (re)visiting.</p>
<p>Dunc from <a href="http://www.theautumnstore.co.uk/">The Autumn Store</a> (and various indiepop bands, I&#8217;ve slightly lost track tbh) has followed this with <a href="http://aboutaboywhosjustlikeme.blogspot.com/2010/02/why-dont-people-come-to-my-gigs-some.html">&#8220;Why Don&#8217;t People Come To My Gigs&#8221;: Some thoughts on audience categorisation</a>. Which is very good and kinda in the vein of the guides to promoting gigs he wrote a while back (have a root through his site).</p>
<p>Following a couple of links, I stumbled across Scene Not Heard which seems to have started at the beginning of this year:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.scenenotheard.co.uk">Scene Not Heard</a> aims to be a  portal for artists and fans alike to the massive great plethora of  musical happenings going on in Birmingham</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://drownedinsound.com/community/boards/music/4229689">a discussion thread about Birmingham&#8217;s music scene</a> on Drowned in Sound, but I think they tend to come round fairly frequently.</p>
<p>Which all adds up to a community of music people in Birmingham all wanting to make stuff happen (standard caveats about &#8216;music&#8217; tending to refer to indie/rock only in these kinds of discussions).</p>
<p>One more thing to highlight in all of this is a line from Dunc&#8217;s post in which he refers to the original discussion on Capsule&#8217;s blog, the significance of which I leave to you to discern:</p>
<blockquote><p>it&#8217;s off the back of an event discussing the &#8216;music industry&#8217; which  always makes me feel like I shouldn&#8217;t be part of the conversation</p></blockquote>
