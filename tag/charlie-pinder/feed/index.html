				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Knowing Me, Knowing You by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/4195043268/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4195043268_94a57b867f.jpg" alt="Knowing Me, Knowing You" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The first of what might become a regular thing, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/12/08/knowing-me-knowing-you/">Knowing Me, Knowing You</a> was fun last week. As part of Capsule&#8217;s longest birthday party&#8230; ever, we got together and invited a bunch of interesting people along to introduce themselves and say (for the sake of getting a conversation going) what they might do if they were to get their hands on VIVID for a little while.</p>
<p>The kind participants were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dandavies23.com/">Dan Davies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/falsedog">Ben Waddington</a></li>
<li>Fin &amp; Ken from a new (currently  nameless) housing co-op</li>
<li>Sara  from <a href="http://www.needlesandhooks.co.uk/">Needles and Hooks</a></li>
<li>Mark Murphy from <a href="http://surely.uk.com/">Surely?</a></li>
<li>Stuart and Ben from <a href="http://www.firstfoldrecords.com">First Fold Records</a> (who&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.firstfoldrecords.com/?p=453">blogged about it</a>)</li>
<li>Sarah from <a href="http://heatlight.blogspot.com/">Heat and Light</a></li>
<li>James Yarker from <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> (well, I read out his submission)</li>
<li>One of Eagle and Feather from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/OOOOKIPPLEOOO">Kipple</a></li>
<li><a href="http://benjavens.blogspot.com/">Ben Javens</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All ably compered by <a href="http://www.jonbounds.co.uk/">Jon Bounds</a> with half-time entertainment provided by <a href="http://pindec.co.uk/">Charlie Pinder</a>&#8216;s cake orchestra.</p>
<p>Truth be told, we weren&#8217;t sure what people would come back with or what sort of direction the evening might take. As it turned out, ideas included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social spaces</li>
<li>Turning the place into a massive ball pool/packing it floor to ceiling with jelly</li>
<li>Setting up a swapshop</li>
<li>Using it as a place for realising unfinished ideas</li>
<li>Creating an edgeless, white room and projecting images through hung pieces of perspex</li>
<li>Kipple Live</li>
<li>Artist talks</li>
</ul>
<p>And some other things that escape me just at the moment. To be honest, the suggestions themselves weren&#8217;t the most crucial part of the evening. The point was really to get people out, meeting each other and sharing thoughts and ideas. As far as that goes I think the evening was a success.</p>
<p>Capsule have <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/?p=895">written up the event here</a> with lots of lovely photos. Thanks to them, to everyone who took part and to those who came along to watch.</p>
