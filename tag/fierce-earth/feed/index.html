<p>I rate Helga and Pete on those subjects and think there&#8217;s a real need for some people to get their heads around this stuff and see that it&#8217;s not as scary or difficult as they might think. That, and I&#8217;m still shaking my head at the berk who told me &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t do business cards&#8221; when I asked if he had any contact details.</p>
<p>More info (including booking) on the <a href="http://fierceearth.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/announcing-metapod-connect-course-booking-now/">Fierce Earth website</a>.</p>
<p>If want to read about the purpose of/thinking behind the course then <a href="http://ash10.com/2011/08/son-of-metapod-connect/">Pete&#8217;s written about that here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Typical.Â  I write a post about the <a href="http://fierceearth.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/fierce-earth-looks-to-the-future/">Fierce Earth blog</a> and what happens?Â  A few hours later Helga Henry, managing director of Fierce Earth, uses that same blog to make a couple of key announcements &#8211; the biggest of which is that:</p>
<blockquote><p>at present I think itâ€™s fair to say that there will not be a Fierce Festival in 2009 but that we will aim to produce 2-3 large scale ambitious public projects throughout â€˜09, one of which may be at the festival time. Our partners too, may still want to programme audacious and risky work in May and June, and we will certainly be working with them as usual to promote performances if they do.</p>
<p>Weâ€™d like to deliver a bigger, more ambitious programme, and it may take some time to sort that out.</p></blockquote>
<p>So it&#8217;s not all bad and a reflection of their ambitions more than anything.Â  It&#8217;s worth reading the whole post for <a href="http://fierceearth.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/fierce-earth-looks-to-the-future/">more about the whys and wherefores</a> but, as Helga says, watch the blog for developments.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also information about Fierce&#8217;s Creative Learning work and the announcement that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Weâ€™re considering announcing a call for projects and inviting ideas for innovative and exciting creative learning projects with people who would be willing to partner Fierce Earth</p></blockquote>
<p>So if that sounds like something you&#8217;d be interested in then that&#8217;s another reason to watch that space.</p>

<p>As well as producing the <a href="http://www.fiercetv.co.uk/">Fierce Festival</a>, Fierce Earth provide training via Metapod (for start-up creatives) and Momentum (for producers/curators).Â  They also offer consultancy services, having recently worked with <a href="http://wwww.birminghamjazz.co.uk/">Birmingham Jazz</a> (amongst several others) and are soon to start working with <a href="http://www.tindalstreet.co.uk/">Tindal Street Press</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like they&#8217;ll also be using the blog to spread the word about interesting opportunities that they come across.Â  Worth keeping an eye on.</p>
