<blockquote><p>I’ll be doing one of my favourite things &#8211; chuntering my way through the wonders of Birmingham, asking for 800 words or so and lovely pics. No one’s getting paid for this, but I hope you’ll join in.</p>
<p>Who should I talk to – where is the new community culture in this city and who are the militant optimists?</p></blockquote>
<p>So, who should he talk to?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The issue of local TV has cropped up again recently.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back <a href="http://talkaboutlocal.org.uk/shott-review">Will Perrin put some thoughts down</a>, responding to government plans to encourage the development of up to twenty new local TV stations by 2015. The general gist of his post (although I&#8217;d encourage you to read it) was that there&#8217;s no need, it won&#8217;t work and, besides, the web would do the job better.</p>
<p><a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2010/08/27/what-would-you-show-from-birmingham-to-demonstrate-how-the-web-can-do-local-better-than-local-tv/">Nick Booth has built on this</a> and claims that Birmingham&#8217;s informal, fledgling network of local, mainly volunteer-led news websites shows that people are already delivering the kind of activity Jeremy Hunt says he wants to encourage using TV stations (see Nick&#8217;s post for details).</p>
<p>My generally unconsidered view on this is that establishing a local TV station wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be a <em>bad</em> thing &#8211; if someone (and I think <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/City-TV-Birmingham/154372226419">City TV</a> are still looking to get involved) can make the finances stack up and run something that doesn&#8217;t depend on handouts then great. It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be a particularly forward-thinking thing to spend public cash on.</p>
<p>If money/time/effort/attention/whatever is going to be spent on local media, I&#8217;d rather it was spent on getting people using the web and using it better &#8211; helping them access local information and publishing it themselves. There&#8217;s no reason video can&#8217;t be part of that &#8211; see I Am Birmingham for an example of someone using a <a href="http://www.iambirmingham.blogspot.com/">website with a free template</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/IAmBirmingham">YouTube account</a> to do regular-ish video content.</p>
<p>Also in the web&#8217;s favour &#8211; costs and barriers to entry are lower and the skills required are more readily transferrable. It&#8217;s also relevant to the government&#8217;s current strategy of closing down public services and replacing them with websites (Jobcentre Plus, Business Link and so on).</p>
<p>The whole &#8216;more TV by 2015&#8217; thing bothers me too. 2015 is five years off. Bear in mid that YouTube is only five years old and you get a sense of  how much things could change in the intervening years.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel I&#8217;m starting to edge slightly further away from CiB-land now. If you want to get involved in the debate then see what people are saying on <a href="http://talkaboutlocal.org.uk/shott-review">Will</a> and <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2010/08/27/what-would-you-show-from-birmingham-to-demonstrate-how-the-web-can-do-local-better-than-local-tv/">Nick</a>&#8216;s posts.</p>
