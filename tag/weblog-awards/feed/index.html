<p>Someone has kindly nominated Created in Birmingham for the award of <a href="http://2008.weblogawards.org/polls/best-uk-blog/">Best UK Blog in the 2008 Weblog Awards</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a public vote and we&#8217;re up against a few of the big politicos &#8211; as I type this we&#8217;re in 2nd and a Spectator-hosted blog is winning &#8211; so any support (votes, forwarding, re-blogging, re-tweeting, etc and so on) would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>It was about this time last year that CiB won the MediaGuardian Award, so I&#8217;m hoping I don&#8217;t let the side down in the award-winning stakes, especially as I&#8217;m passing the reins on in a few weeks. Speaking of which, I should also say that <a href="http://peteashton.com/">Pete Ashton&#8217;s blog</a> has been nominated too, and rightly so.</p>
