				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a> kicks off on 19 April and runs through to 15 May.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/idfb2010.jpg" rel="lightbox[5377]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5381" title="idfb2010" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/idfb2010.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="144" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/idfb2010.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/idfb2010-300x86.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>At this point I should chuck in a disclaimer that I&#8217;ve been working with the festival&#8217;s organisers for a year or so on how they approach things online. However, that does mean that I&#8217;ve got a bit of a clue about what the line-up includes. Which is nice, because there are any number of ways of slicing and dicing a festival&#8217;s programme &#8211; this is my attempt to group it up a bit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more going on than I&#8217;ll mention here so see the IDFB website&#8217;s <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on-list/">What&#8217;s On</a> and <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/take-part/">Taking Part</a> pages for the whole caboodle.</p>
<p><strong>Local stuff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/5-soldiers">Rosie Kay Dance Company &#8211; 5 SOLDIERS The Body is the Frontline</a> &#8211; Rosie&#8217;s based in Birmingham and this is a new commission which will explore the physical toll taken by war</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/out-of-time">Colin Dunne &#8211; Out of Time</a> &#8211; Colin was born in Birmingham, was nine times world Irish step dance champion and also principal dancer in Riverdance. This is his first full-length solo work</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/funny-bones">DX Productions &amp; Two&#8217;s Company &#8211; Funny Bones</a> &#8211; something for the kids: a brand new in-the-round double bill of contemporary dance for over 5&#8217;s.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5379" title="Gnosis | International Dance Festival Birmingham" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Gnosis-International-Dance-Festival-Birmingham1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Gnosis-International-Dance-Festival-Birmingham1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Gnosis-International-Dance-Festival-Birmingham1-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><strong>Big ticket items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/gnosis">Akram Khan Company &#8211; Gnosis</a>. See pic above.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lallegro-il-penseroso-ed-il-moderato">Mark Morris Dance Group &#8211; L’Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato</a>. This has had more 5 star reviews than I&#8217;ve had hot dinners.</li>
<li>Ballet Nacional de Cuba &#8211; <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/magia-de-la-danza">Magia de la Danza</a> and <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/giselle">Giselle</a>.</li>
<li>Outspoken Weekend. Something you won&#8217;t see anywhere else &#8211; a season dedicated to new performances from Arab artists, 8 shows in all (see the <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on-list/">What&#8217;s On page</a> for the lot)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Something a bit different</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/sutra">Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui/Sadler&#8217;s Wells London &#8211; Sutra</a>. 17 Shaolin monks. A set designed by Antony Gormley. Sharp suits. Nuff said.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/circa">C!RCA &#8211; Circa</a>. Described as &#8216;a thoroughly new circus&#8217;. This was a big hit at last the Edinburgh Festival Fringe</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/running-sushi">Chris Haring &#8211; Running Sushi</a>. I don&#8217;t know much about this other than that it&#8217;ll be at Ikon Eastside and the order of the 12 performances will be chosen by audience members who picking sushi off a plate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Free stuff</strong></p>
<p>For IDFB 2008, Victoria Square was taken over by two stages, gantries, firecracker-stuffed cars and three dance companies. It was so good I went twice. This year we&#8217;re told that:</p>
<blockquote><p>contemporary dancers will form a brand new dance company collective alongside Russian, Spanish, Indian and African folk dance groups, all moving to the turbo-folk Gypsy and Balkan beats of Birmingham’s very own band The Destroyers</p></blockquote>
<p>The event&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/utopia">UTOPIA</a> and will be performed a few times over the Bank Holiday weekend of 1-3 May. In the words of the choreographer:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’ll be bits of furniture all over the place and basically it’ll look like 40 people, plus the band, have attacked the square</p></blockquote>
<p>Which sounds pretty good. As does <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/waves">Waves</a>, which is right up my street. Wander past the Hippodrome between 8-11pm from 22 April to 5 May to see/play with that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/put-your-foot-down">Put Your Foot Down</a> is the final showpiece on 15 May &#8211; an afternoon of free performances and dance demos, with a mass synchronised hip hop/street dance routine lead by Salah, a hugely popular hip hop artist from France, in St Martin&#8217;s Square, Bullring.</p>
<p><strong>Taking part</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a whole bunch of <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/take-part/">workshops and classes you can get involved in</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition.jpg" rel="lightbox[5003]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5004" title="British Dance Edition" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="248" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>During my first stint on Created in Birmingham I had a nagging feeling that there was loads of good dance stuff going on but it was all happening under my radar. I&#8217;m pretty much on top of it these days, partly for the reasons given in the disclaimer at the bottom of this post but mainly because there&#8217;s so much dance stuff happening around the city this year.</p>
<p>Anyway, from tomorrow until Sunday, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk">British Dance Edition</a> &#8211; a biennial showcase of the British dance scene &#8211; is in Birmingham. It&#8217;s a big deal, with <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/venues/">loads of venues</a> hosting performances, events, presentations and debates. It&#8217;s a national showcase, not a local one, but there&#8217;s a fair bit of local interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rosie Kay previewing her new piece, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/the-body-is-the-frontline">5 SOLDIERS &#8211; The Body Is The Frontline</a></li>
<li>DanceXchange showing some of their work on <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/repeat-performance-the-5-man-show">The 5 Man Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/listen">Listen</a> by Ace Dance &amp; Music</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/funny-bones">Funny Bones</a>, from dX and Two&#8217;s Company Management</li>
<li>Receptions hosted by <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/international-dance-festival-birmingham-reception">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/reception-birmingham-royal-ballet-and-elmhurst-sch">Birmingham Royal Ballet</a> and <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/reception-people-dancing">People Dancing</a>.</li>
<li>Walking tours of the city for delegates (<a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/digbeth-walking-tour-with-ian-jelf">Digbeth</a> and the <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/birmingham-city-walking-tour-3-jewellery-quarter">Jewellery Quarter</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more too. Most of it&#8217;s for paying delegates only but there are <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/public-events/">some good public events too</a>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer &#8211; I&#8217;m working on/at British Dance Edition (incl <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/multi-platform-dance-the-future-of-dance-online">one of the debates</a>) and <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>. <a href="http://westmidlandsdance.com/">WestMidlandsDance.com</a> is one of my websites too.</p>
