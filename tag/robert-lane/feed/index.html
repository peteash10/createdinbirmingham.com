Due to launch in 2009, debut magazine proposes to &#8220;provide a platform from which creative people, whether artists, musicians, designers or performers to showcase their talents to a wider audience&#8221;.

Robert is a musician and on his blog he documents the trials and tribulations of working the West Mids gig circuit.  It&#8217;s well worth a read.  He&#8217;s also a member of a comedy troupe called the new Raving Loonies Stole My Heart.  Their new show, The Terrifying Tour of Terrible Terror calls at the Arena in Wolverhampton on the 30th of October. Swearing and scariness is promised</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/">Flatpack Festival // 11-15 March 2009 &#8211;</a><br />
The newly designed Flatpack Festival site has launched.  There&#8217;s a call for submissions on there <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">but because it&#8217;s one of those slightly infuriating websites that don&#8217;t have distinct pages to link to I can&#8217;t point that out to you. It&#8217;s easy enough to spot though</span> Amateur that I am, I didn&#8217;t spot the permanent links &#8211; <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/submissions">here&#8217;s the submissions one</a> (ta Ian!)</li>
