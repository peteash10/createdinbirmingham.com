<p><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/project-twilightofthefreakingods.html">Twilightofthefreakingods</a> is Stan&#8217;s Cafe&#8217;s celebration of five wonderful years @ A E Harris. It&#8217;s a large scale theatrical experiment taking place this Thursday and Saturday (<em>Saturday event sold out</em>), with a cast comprising of companies who have performed @ A E Harris over the last five years. There will be no rehearsals, and the cast will work from instructions and timetables given to them, with no idea what anyone else in the room will be doing &#8211; sure to result in surprises for the cast and audience alike.</p>
<blockquote><p>As the show is both a celebration and unusually long, the bar will be open throughout serving flaming cocktails alongside snacks and more familiar drinks. Both cabaret and raked seating will be available for you to either engross yourself in the show or discuss it as it unfolds with your friends. You can change your viewing angle whenever you wish to concentrate on whatever strand of action you find most absorbing. Whatever happens it will be an event to which you will always want to say &#8220;and I was there&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/project-twilightofthefreakingods.html">Twilightofthefreakingods</a> will be the last performance at the venue before it &#8216;downsizes&#8217;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although I made it along to the Pointe Blank launch on Monday, I missed the launch of <a title="The Voyage" href="http://www.thevoyage.org.uk/">The Voyage</a> &#8211; a big, public spectacle taking place in Victoria Square over four nights (21 to 24 June) as one of the opening events for the <a title="London 2012 Cultural Olympiad" href="http://www.london2012.com/cultural-olympiad">London 2012 Cultural Olympiad</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s being produced by the <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/">Hippodrome</a> and created by <a href="http://www.motionhouse.co.uk/">Motionhouse</a> and <a href="http://www.legsonthewall.com.au/">Legs On The Wall</a>. The latter&#8217;s website says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em></em>It involves six performers from Legs, twelve from Motionhouse, a choir of 40, an all women brass band and 140 community performers. It is co-directed by Legs On The Wall’s Artistic Director Patrick Nolan and Motionhouse’s Kevin Finnan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds impressive.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is a good example of how to do a website for a project that hasn&#8217;t launched yet. None of this &#8216;watch this space&#8217; or &#8216;come back when we&#8217;re ready&#8217; nonsense. Instead grab a website visitor&#8217;s contact details so you can let them know as soon as there&#8217;s any news.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thevoyage.org.uk/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11697" title="The Voyage" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Voyage.png" alt="The Voyage" width="600" height="509" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Voyage.png 600w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Voyage-300x254.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Oh, and I&#8217;ve also been reminded that Stan&#8217;s Cafe are doing <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/project-the-voyage.html">a Cultural Olympiad-related project called The Voyage</a>. That one will be on 6 May.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A touch of grouchiness for a Monday morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/business-comment/more-business-comment/2011/10/07/ammo-talwar-time-to-invest-in-local-talent-65233-29550783/">Ammo reckons Birmingham&#8217;s arts scene is too safe and middle-aged</a>, claiming that rather than providing art that appeals to Brummies, &#8220;a human tide of middle class professionals floods Birmingham each day from the suburban shanty towns that ring our city&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Groomed by the local authority and a small elite of ‘tastemakers’, half-a-dozen ‘flagship’ venues and ventures in the city centre now hoover up most of the taxpayer and corporate cash. Just like the banks, they’ve become ‘too big to fail’.</p>
<p>More and more their programming reflects the tastes – and train timetables – of an alien clique.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1841">Stan&#8217;s Cafe remind us</a> that, as of 1 October, city council funding for some of the smaller organisations ended (see <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/12/14/birmingham-arts-and-arts-grant-budgets-for-201112/">my post with bonus hedgehog vid here</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>last time I did the sums it appeared 50% of the City’s revenue funded portfolio was being cut by 100% to save 2.6% of the Arts Revenue budget. I can’t conceive how the city missed out on its last two bids to be crowned a Capital/City of Culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>That last bit was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggXmKPMaHMo">sarcastic</a>, btw.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the closure of the Creative Partnerships Programme, <a title="Bright Space" href="http://www.brightspace.org.uk/">Bright Space</a> announced that they would be closing. Today&#8217;s their last day.</p>
<p>This from <a title="Stan's Cafe" href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1832">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s sad because Brightspace were behind a huge number of inspirational projects that took artists into schools to work creatively with students and teachers. Now, despite a great report from OFSTED setting out the great value of these projects, the plug as been pulled, the axe has fallen, the bubble burst, the goose cooked, the turkey plucked, the swan sung and the full stopped.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d lost track of what&#8217;s happening with <a title="Creative England" href="http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/">Creative England</a> &#8211; I thought it was going to be based on a partnership of all the screen agencies <a href="http://www.rewiredpr.com/news/entry/screen_wm_brings_curtain_down_as_creative_england_takes_on_support_role/">but here&#8217;s a press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday 30th September 2011, regional screen agency Screen WM will bring the curtain down on nine years of support for the screen media industries in the West Midlands and welcome Creative England as the new umbrella body for the creative sector.</p>
<p>The closure of <a title="Screen WM" href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Screen WM</a> follows the coalition government’s decision to replace the <a title="UK Film Council" href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank">UK Film Council’s</a> support for film-making, which core-funded the regional screen agencies, with funding through the British Film Institute.</p></blockquote>
<p>All the best to the folks working at these organisations who are moving on.</p>
<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m predicting a few more posts like this over the next few months.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to see <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/project-constance-brown.html">Stan&#8217;s Cafe&#8217;s <em>The Cleansing of Constance Brown</em></a> at AE Harris on Saturday. It was superb and I&#8217;d thoroughly recommend grabbing some tickets before it closes on Saturday. Unless it&#8217;s already sold out. By rights it should&#8217;ve done that long ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably better to go with no expectations/preconceptions of about what you&#8217;re about to see but, in case you&#8217;d rather take someone else&#8217;s word for how it good it is:</p>
