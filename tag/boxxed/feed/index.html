				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://boxxed.co.uk/">Boxxed</a> – the art, film, music and education venue on Floodgate Street in Digbeth – is to close its doors.</p>
<p><a title="Drum &amp; Bass Awards 2011 by boxxed, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boxxed/5556356238/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5027/5556356238_681401e987.jpg" alt="Drum &amp; Bass Awards 2011" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The venue – which hosted the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/03/30/juice-aleem-rock-my-hologram/">shoot for Juice Aleem&#8217;s Rock My Hologram music video</a> and more – made this announcement on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/boxxed/boxxed-closure/221623607891671">their Facebook page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s with a great deal of sadness that we have to announce BOXXED ceased trading on Monday the 19th Sept 2011. We&#8217;ve had fun and we hope everyone that experienced our unique space did too, but it&#8217;s time for us to bow out.</p>
<p>Massive thanks go to everyone that was part of our project, particularly Dave Checkley, Ksmk Neil, all the graff guys that painted our walls just for the love of it (especially Hoaks &amp; Fluid), The Project Pigeon Crew and everyone that volunteered their time to help us out. You know who you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://digbeth.org/">Digbeth is Good</a> (hat-tip for <a href="http://digbeth.org/2011/09/boxxed-has-closed/">posting about this originally</a>), <a href="http://www.project-pigeon.co.uk/Site/Coming_up.html">Project Pigeon</a>, which is based on Boxxed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/">Custard Factory</a> grounds, will be unaffected for now and there will be a couple of closing parties at the venue to see it off in style. Inquiries should be directed to the Boxxed team on 07826 523 650.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://iamcamera.co.uk/home.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-5974 aligncenter" title="I Am Camera" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/boxxed1.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="436" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/boxxed1.jpg 290w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/boxxed1-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s some more words about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>I Am Camera is a collective showcase of work put together by a group of emerging and established artists who are currently rooted within Birmingham.</p>
<p>The exhibition will showcase the work of these artists who all come from a wide range of visual media professions including Fine Art, Documentary, Landscape, Fashion and Commercial roles.</p>
<p>I Am Camera is happy to be bringing this event to the heart of Birmingham between the 10th &amp; 19th of June. There will most  certainly be something for everyone to feast their eyes upon so why not pop by say hello and enjoy the work on show?</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve heard plenty of grumbling over the past little while that there&#8217;s not enough space around the city for doing &#8216;stuff&#8217; in, so this might be interesting to a fair few.</p>
<p><strong>Media Kube Productions &#8211; 5-7  Vaughton Street South</strong> (a couple of mins from Five Ways)</p>
<p>In the words of Pete Homer from <a href="http://www.media-kube.com/">Media Kube Productions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are a media company based in B&#8217;ham who have created a media / music creative apprenticeship course for young people aged between 16-24 wanting to get into creative industries.</p>
<p>We also have two large beautiful open plan warehouses that would be ideal for like minded people to use and bring to life with creative projects such as art gallery / exhibition space, filming etc</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re also looking at renting office or desk space  to create a good working environment for creative businesses.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the space looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/mediakubestudio.JPG" rel="lightbox[3952]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3953" title="mediakubestudio" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/mediakubestudio.JPG" alt="mediakubestudio" width="480" height="320" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/mediakubestudio.JPG 480w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/mediakubestudio-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21167151/Studio-Poster-Copy">a flyer with more info</a>. For enquiries, get in touch with Pete Homer at <a href="mailto:pete@media-kube.com">pete@media-kube.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Boxxed &#8211; 104-106 Floodgate Street, Digbeth</strong></p>
<p>Recently used for shooting a music video for Basement Jaxx and intended to be used for workshops, exhibitions and events. No pics, but there&#8217;s more info on <a href="http://www.boxxed.co.uk/">Boxxed&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
