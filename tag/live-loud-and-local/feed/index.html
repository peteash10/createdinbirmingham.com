<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="The Rainbow, Digbeth by ell brown, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ell-r-brown/4001545606/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2572/4001545606_b5352b4485.jpg" alt="The Rainbow, Digbeth" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://interactivecultures.org/music-as-culture/music-as-culture-online">Interactive Cultures</a> team at BCU have launched <a href="http://musicasculture.org/">MusicAsCulture.org</a> &#8211; a place to discuss the idea that &#8216;music is not just commerce&#8217;. It&#8217;s not an exclusively local thing, but it launches with a Birmingham-focussed  campaign dealing with the noise issues at The Rainbow in Digbeth. The campaign is being headed up by UB40 and is called Live, Loud and Local:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here in Birmingham, as with many places elsewhere, heritage music venues are in danger of closure or losing their live music licence because of issues of noise. Areas that were once not residential now have tenants, and the clash between apartment dwellers and local music venues has demanded a response at a policy level</p></blockquote>
<p>UB40 will be playing a one-off gig at The Rainbow on 3 November to raise money for a new roof on the building in an attempt to reduce outside noise. I don&#8217;t know where you can get tickets from yet, but then nor do <a href="http://www.ub40.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=101266&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=50&amp;sid=5f7ee57f56d3fb52d216c302143863fc">the folks on the UB40 forum</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/2009/10/09/johnny-foreigner/">Fused interviewed Johnny Foreigner</a> who aren&#8217;t afraid of sticking the boot in. They&#8217;re working on a documentary about how Birmingham&#8217;s music scene &#8220;suffers as a result when compared to other major cities&#8221;, which they see as a result of neglect by the council. Their advice for the city:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Drop the ego like Liverpool or nurture the homegrown stuff like Leeds and see the results in five years time when there are famous and forward looking bands not ashamed to say where theyâ€™re from</span></strong></p></blockquote>
