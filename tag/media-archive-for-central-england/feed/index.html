<p><a href="http://www.macearchive.org/">MACE</a> (Media Archive for Central England) are currently working on <a href="http://www.macearchive.org/Film/FULL_CIRCLE.html">The Full Circle Project</a>, which will run for 3 years as they hunt down hidden or forgotten film footage and home-movies from the past 100 years, created by people of the Midlands.</p>
<p>The aim is to make these materials accessible to the community so that they can be widely enjoyed by future generations and used for research, in exhibitions, screenings and education work.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our concern at MACE is that films and videos are disappearing fast.  We  want to stem the tide by working with organisations across the midlands  to help them find and &#8216;save&#8217; their local community&#8217;s moving image  heritage.</p></blockquote>
<p>For more information on the Full Circle Project, <a href="http://www.macearchive.org.uk/Contact.html">contact Mace</a> or visit their <a href="http://www.macearchive.org.uk">website</a> / <a href="http://macearchive.wordpress.com">blog</a> for full details on what they do with donated film, and the local organisations involved.</p>

Worth bearing in mind &#8211; &#8220;I’ve worked out over a few years that “private view” means two things: if a show is big and important it means “no entry unless you’re invited”, if a show is small or not that well known it means “please come, there’ll be free wine and nibbles”. It’s developed as art-jargon for some reason, and people who know know and those that don’t don’t. But it does put off people who might otherwise have liked to have attended—and the smaller shows could do with that, in fact they want it.&#8221; Now to decide if your show is big and important or if it&#8217;s smaller</li>
