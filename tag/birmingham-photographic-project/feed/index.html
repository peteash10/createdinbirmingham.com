<p>The results of an interesting collaborative project, carried out in 2007, are just coming out.  The project used the question &#8216;what does this city really look like?&#8217; as a starting point.</p>
<blockquote><p>Locations were shared-out between a team of &#8216;photographers&#8217; (none of them are photographers) according to a grid imposed over the area.Â  The photographers were free to capture whatever they wanted at their location, but it was the grid that determined the locations in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can browse the photos on the <a href="http://www.birmingham-photographic-grid.org.uk/">Birmingham Photographic Project</a> website and it&#8217;s worth a look.</p>
<p>The results of the project are being presented in stages &#8211; the website being th first with a (limited-run) hardback book and a public exhibition both not far off official announcement.</p>
