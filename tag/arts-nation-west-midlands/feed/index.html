				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An email from the Arts Council tells me that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first ever arts engagement campaign delivered against Arts Council England&#8217;s mission of great art for everyone goes live as a national pilot in September</p></blockquote>
<p>I went along to <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/11/25/arts-councils-new-public-engagement-campaign/">a thing about this</a> in November last year. The focus in this part of the world will be on the Black Country and the Arts Council have given Audiences Central some cash to run some trials over the summer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wolverhampton</strong> where The Shape of Things touring craft exhibition was held at Bilston Craft Gallery May to July. It focused on family and community and mid-life hobbyists.  It included family friendly events and participatory activity.</li>
<li><strong>Sandwell </strong>where the Sandwell Arts Festival during the last two weeks of July was developed as a flagship for the area. It was timed to coincide with the Cultural Olympiad Weekend. It  included:  a children&#8217;s music festival; theatre for all generations, a tea dance and arts workshops; Bollywood Brass Band; dance events; an art exhibition and young people&#8217;s music at the Public; outdoor participatory performances by Multi-Storey and Black Country Touring.</li>
<li><strong>Dudley </strong>where their successful Artspace project involving empty shops has been developed. The original project worked with Adult Learning and Dudley and they have used the experience to create an initiative for Arts Nation involving many organisations. It will target families and communities as well as mid-life hobbyists.</li>
<li><strong>Walsall </strong>where they have set up an Arts Nation steering group of local arts organisations.  They are also carrying out research to find out how arts and culture is delivered through services including health, social services, sport, children&#8217;s services and The New Art Gallery</li>
</ul>

Not sure this has been linked to from here &#8211; a list of women who have made a significant contribution to Birmingham</li>
<li><a href="http://artsnationwestmidlands.co.uk/">Arts Nation West Midlands</a><br />
&#8220;The Arts Nation West Midlands project is an Arts Council England West Midlands funded initiative, developed and delivered by Audiences Central, that aims to address the national priority of Public Engagement in 2010/11 and beyond&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://neversaymusic.wordpress.com/">Never Say</a><br />
&#8220;Being based in Birmingham, I have seen the creation of a genuine music scene being built with many fantastic, hardworking and honest people being at the fundamental heart of it. I will write about shows and events taking place in this city which I feel don’t get credit they deserve&#8221;</li>

&#8220;Ok folks we’re experimenting with this new technology malarky and so as well as finding our latest zine at our shows and in selected places in Brum you can now read it online&#8221;</li>
