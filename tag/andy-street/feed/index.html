				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I went to the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/10/12/something-about-a-creative-city/">previously-mentioned</a> <strong>Birmingham Creative City</strong> launch at lunchtime.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d still struggle to explain exactly what it <em>is</em>, so here&#8217;s some blurb from the <a href="http://birminghamnewsroom.com/2011/10/culture-minister-launches-birmingham-creative-city-initiative/">council&#8217;s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Creative City initiative will play a significant role by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a fund to build on existing public sector funding of the arts through loans, grants, match-funding and investments. The allocation of funds will be based on the potential for job creation and economic growth.</li>
<li>Outlining the vision for a new ‘museum quarter’, including a new museum of photography and the development of a new contemporary art gallery.</li>
<li>Exploring ways to unlock private sector and philanthropic support for culture, linking cultural development to wider economic growth.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So this was really the launch of an idea. In the way that Manchester has <a href="http://www.mediacityuk.co.uk/">Media City</a> and London has <a href="http://www.techcityuk.com/">Tech City</a>, Birmingham (if it wants it) could claim the title of Creative City.</p>
<p>Thing is, the designations of those other two seem to have been built on much stronger foundations (a strong BBC presence and an already burgeoning tech scene, respectively). All we seem to have at the moment is ideas, visions (like <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B3OX4ags5zyuMmM3YmFhYjItZDFkYi00YTg5LTgzNmEtZmZjZjcwY2QxZTM1&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1">this one for a Museum Quarter</a>), pledges and plans with comparatively little substance. Maybe&#8217;s it&#8217;s just early days, but if the intention of this event was to make people excited about the possibilities on offer then I don&#8217;t think it worked.</p>
<p>Maybe the more substantial conversations are all taking place behind closed doors this afternoon &#8211; but then I got the sense from others that therein lies the problem. Chatting to people afterwards actually left me kinda depressed by it all.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m not sure what to make of it and I&#8217;m pretty busy, so <a href="http://soundcloud.com/chrisunitt/sets/birmingham-creative-city">here&#8217;s the audio from the speeches</a> that were made. Please have a listen (they&#8217;re all quite short) and I&#8217;d love to hear what you make of this in the comments below.</p>
<p><object width="100%" height="205" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1234819" /><embed width="100%" height="205" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1234819" allowscriptaccess="always" /></object></p>
<p>In typical <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDKQliH1awY">Peter O&#8217;Hanra-Hanrahan</a> style, I managed to miss the bit where James Yarker from <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> thanked Cllr Timothy Huxtable for name-checking his theatre company but asked him how he squared that with the council cutting their funding by 100%. The response is in the final audio clip above (although it does make for uncomfortable listening).</p>
<p><strong>On the subject</strong></p>
<p>It would be hugely remiss of me not to point out <a href="http://iam.peteashton.com/birmingham-will-break-your-art/">this rather angry post by Pete Ashton</a>, many of the sentiments of which I would endorse.</p>
<p><strong>A couple more links</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1867">This from James at Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> should be read</li>
<li>As should <a href="http://stef.io/2011/10/some-thoughts-about-birmingham-creative-city">this from Stef Lewandowski</a>, should be read too, with some interesting comments</li>
<li><a href="http://philipparkin.com/2011/10/26/birmingham-creative-city/">Philip Parkin is upbeat but says</a> he &#8220;struggled to find the substance&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://bopconsulting.typepad.com/bop-consultings-culture/2011/10/birmingham-the-creative-city.html">BOP Consulting point out</a> this launch is all &#8220;particularly interesting as it is one of the first LEPs to announce its ambitions for the creative industries&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://iam.peteashton.com/creative-city-fallout/">Pete&#8217;s done a round-up of some of the discussion</a></li>
<li>Pete also pointed to <a href="http://www.restirred.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=1886">the discussion on the Re-Stirred forum</a></li>
</ul>
