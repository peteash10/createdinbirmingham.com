				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time a disgruntled promoter will write something accusing the people of Birmingham of being an apathetic bunch who&#8217;d rather stay at home than go out and have a good time. See <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/02/05/a-round-up-of-some-recent-music-discussions/">this post from a year ago</a> for an example.</p>
<p>James Cook has joined this cohort with a post titled &#8216;<a title="Post detail page of &quot;Why the Birmingham comedy scene repeatedly dies on its hole...&quot;" href="http://nottheexplorer.blog.co.uk/2011/02/28/why-the-birmingham-comedy-scene-repeatedly-dies-on-its-hole-10718505/">Why the Birmingham comedy scene repeatedly dies on its hole&#8230;</a>&#8216;. His gripes are that (and I apologise for paraphrasing):</p>
<ul>
<li>research shows that residents of Birmingham are the most risk averse in the country. We have a drinking culture, but not much of a &#8216;going out&#8217; culture. This makes things difficult for promoters</li>
<li>there are too many poor quality comedy night charging people good money to see new, unpaid acts. These nights are rubbish and will put people off ever going to a comedy night again</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim to know too much about this &#8211; I go to the occasional stand-up show, but I don&#8217;t have James&#8217;s experience of the local comedy scene and he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/2010/01/28/engaging-regional-audiences-how-do-we-do-it/#comment-32039877">not the first</a> to have made this complaint. However, from a lay punter&#8217;s point of view, I was under the impression that if comedy&#8217;s your thing then Birmingham caters for you pretty well. We&#8217;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.thenia.co.uk/">NIA</a> and <a href="http://www.lgarena.co.uk/">LG Arena</a> for the big, mainstream touring shows</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">Town Hall</a> and <a href="http://www.alexandratheatre.org.uk/">Alexandra Theatre</a> for other biggish touring shows</li>
<li>two main stand-up venues &#8211; <a href="http://www.glee.co.uk/">The Glee Club</a> and <a href="http://www.thehighlight.co.uk/birmingham/upcoming-shows">Highlight</a></li>
<li>other occasional shows at <a href="http://www.thepublic.com/">The Public</a> and the <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">MAC</a>. <a href="http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/">Warwick Arts Centre</a> and various places in Wolverhampton are fairly close too</li>
<li>some smaller, regular nights bringing in some decent national names (<a href="http://www.comedyjunction.co.uk/">Comedy Junction</a> and <a href="http://www.popcorncomedy.com/category/locations/birmingham/">Popcorn Comedy</a>)</li>
<li>there&#8217;s a proliferation of other, smaller nights at pubs and bars around over the city too</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of general promotion, we&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">dedicated comedy website</a> and (almost?) every year the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> draws a ring around a load of shows happening over the space of a month and shouts about them.</p>
<p>That seems like a pretty healthy spread to me. Certainly a good deal more than many other towns and cities can claim. Does it constitute a &#8216;scene&#8217;? If not, is it just the audiences for the smaller gigs that are missing, or something else?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested in hearing what people think. Or, seeing as how he started the discussion, leave a comment on <a href="http://nottheexplorer.blog.co.uk/2011/02/28/why-the-birmingham-comedy-scene-repeatedly-dies-on-its-hole-10718505/">James&#8217;s post</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After its Brum debut at the <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/david.freak/bcf/popcorn_comedy.htm">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> last year, cult London comedy night <a href="http://popcorncomedy.com">Popcorn Comedy</a> is back, this time at <a href="http://www.thevictoriabirmingham.co.uk/">The Victoria</a> on <strong>Thursday 25th March 2010</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Popcorn Comedy showcases the funniest comedy videos from around the internet, combined with live stand ups and character comedians, who mix in their own comedy videos for good measure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This time, Popcorn has live performances from <a href="http://www.robrouse.com/">Rob Rouse</a> (<em>8 out of 10 Cats, Grown Ups</em>) and <a href="http://briandennisgittins.blogspot.com/">Brian Gittins</a> (described by Ricky Gervais as<em> &#8220;One of the best comedy characters of the decade&#8221;</em>). I&#8217;ll be hosting the night along with my <a href="http://www.diceproductions.co.uk">Dice Productions</a> cronies, so I&#8217;ll see you there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s a fiver in (and less for students), so <a href="http://popcornbrum.eventbrite.com">follow this link and book your tickets for Popcorn Comedy.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Very late notice, but if you&#8217;re at a loose end tonight then you could do a lot worse than head over to the Electric Cinema for the Birmingham launch of stand-up/video comedy phenomenon <a href="http://www.popcorncomedy.com/?p=167">Popcorn Comedy</a>:</p>

<p>Tickets are £6, <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/booking/book.php?date=1453">get them from the Electric Cinema website</a> or, more realistically given the time, on the door. I&#8217;ll be going along, maybe see you there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the cockles of my heart &#8211; how they are warmed.</p>
<p>Created in Birmingham doesn&#8217;t tend to cover comedy very much although, as people have pointed out, there&#8217;s no lack of creativity going on with it.Â  The problem is that, although I come across plenty of listings, there&#8217;s been no-one (that I&#8217;ve found) writing passionately and consistently about the city&#8217;s comedy scene.</p>
<p>Until now &#8211; enter <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">Who&#8217;s Laughing Now?</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" rel="lightbox[2157]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2158" title="whoslaughingnow" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="408" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With news, listings, features and a kind of curation area for YouTube vids, it&#8217;s been launched to coincide with the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> and is the brainchild of Rich Batsford and Simon Harper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.richbatsford.com/?p=309">Rich explains on his own blog</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The site has been created with the intent of developing the comedy scene in the area and is more or less an open forum &#8211; we are very happy for all local promoters to send in previews of their events.</p>
<p>We are also on the lookout for other writers or budding journalists who are interested in publishing reviews through the site. Whilst thereâ€™s no money on offer, its all good experience and we would expect to be able to get free show tickets for our contributors when they are reviewing a show. Are you interested? &#8211; please <a href="mailto:info@whoslaughingnow.org">contact us</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really chuffed to see this and think there&#8217;s a whole heap of potential here, so good luck to them.</p>

<p>Comedy escapes CiB&#8217;s notice most of the time so here goes a mention of the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival 2008</a>, featuring an impressive list of talent, including the Edinburgh Festival&#8217;s newly crowned Perrier (or whatever) Award Winner, David O&#8217;Doherty.</p>
<p>Holding up Birmingham&#8217;s end are drag duo Patrick and Bernadine (Solihull Arts Complex, 4 Oct) and a whole host of local folk at &#8216;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/wroteunder">Wrote Under</a> and Friends Comedy&#8217; at the Kitchen Garden Cafe on .Â  There&#8217;s possibly a few more localers too, but none I recognised on <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/2008.htm">the festival&#8217;s listings page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk/">The Old Joint Stock Theatre</a> is also hosting a day dedicated to Tony Hancock at the Old Joint Stock Theatre on 11 October.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the big names that will stick out, of course, and there are plenty of those this year.Â  As long as Dylan Moran, Mark Steel and Ted Chippington get the attention they deserve all will be well.</p>
<p>The festival starts on 3 October and ends on 12 October.Â  Visit the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival website</a> for more info.</p>
