Plants rescued from Stirchley&#8217;s derelict sites will be given back to<br />
the community &#8211; come and take a plant and its story &#8211; information on<br />
where it has come from and where it would like to live, but be quick,<br />
there are around 40 plants looking for new homes, and they&#8217;re sure to<br />
be popular!</p>

Feel inspired by the plants and their stories? Contribute to the plant<br />
poetry board&#8230;</p>
