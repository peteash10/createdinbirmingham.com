				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw the <a href="http://www.theheritageorchestra.com/">The Heritage Orchestra</a> at the Town Hall (one of their rather good <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/page/contact-us/press-office/resonance-events-present-the-heritage-orchestra-orchestra-performing-the-music-of-amon-tobin/">resonance events</a>) last month and they were great, so I was chuffed to hear about Birmingham Jazz&#8217;s plans for celebrating <a href="http://www.stansulzmann.co.uk/">Stan Sulzmann</a>&#8216;s birthday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stan Sulzmann has had a long relationship with Birmingham Jazz and is a Honorary Fellow at Birmingham Conservatoire.  So when Stan mentioned that he will be 60 this November, plans were immediately put in place to mark the event in Birmingham with a concert with a small version of The Heritage Orchestra (THO) and with arrangements of Stanâ€™s material by both Jules Buckley and Stan himself.</p>
<p>Stan will be playing with THOâ€™s 13-piece string section plus an extended rhythm section with piano, bass, drums, guitar and percussion.  There will also be new material written for the occasion by Stan himself and by THO members Tom Richards and Sam Bullard</p></blockquote>
<p>Woo-hoo! It&#8217;s on Sat 29 Nov at the CBSO Centre and <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/birmingham-jazz-season---stan-sulzmanns-60th-birth">tickets are available NOW</a>!</p>
<p>Info about Stan Sulzmann&#8217;s 60th Birthday Celebration is here along with all the other stuff Birmingham Jazz have got on this month (ooh, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/porticoquartet">Portico Quartet</a> on the 28th).</p>
