				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isn&#8217;t new, not by a long stretch, but I&#8217;ve only just found it. You may well be aware that <a href="http://www.acmewhistles.co.uk">Acme</a>, based in the Jewellery Quarter invented the whistle. Or at least founder Joseph Hudson did, back in 1883.</p>
<p>So Acme make whistles. Millions of them a year. For everyone. That&#8217;s impressive.</p>
<p>Almost as impressive as this contraption &#8211; a two-man flying whistle called the <a href="http://www.acmewhistles.co.uk/xcart/pages.php?pageid=9">Acme Meteor</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/acme_1_big.jpg" rel="lightbox[5016]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5015" title="acme_1_big" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/acme_1_big.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/acme_1_big.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/acme_1_big-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The idea was to drop it from 10.000 feet and have two parachutists pilot it around in a spiral. In the process it would break the world record for the loudest ever whistle.</p>
<p>That was back in 2003. I couldn&#8217;t work out whether anyone has ever flown it (and <a href="http://musicthing.blogspot.com/2008/04/surprising-and-wonderful-history-of.html">nor could Tom Whitwell</a> when he looked at Acme). Given that there&#8217;s some doubt, I think we can assume it hasn&#8217;t happened.</p>
<p>I imagine they get a bit of stick over the company&#8217;s name, but when they make something that you could easily imagine Wil-E-Coyote riding to his doom then you&#8217;ve got to think they bring it on themselves. Which I think makes them even more wonderful.</p>
