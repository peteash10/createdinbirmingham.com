<p>&#8220;<strong>Birmingham: The Magic City </strong>is a snapshot of overlapping perceptions, an exploration of the unknown underground sub-infrastructure of the city, a collage of 1980s Grindcore fanzines from the birthplace of heavy metal, a day in the life of walkers of Birmingham, an orgy of civic boosterism and a reconstruction of a ‘creepy’ wooden lath wall. Welcome to Birmingham.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weareeastside.org/">We Are Eastside</a> have curated pieces of Birmingham&#8217;s history into an exhibition that&#8217;s part of the <a href="http://liverpoolbiennial.co.uk/programmes/festivals/whatson/38/4/2012/521/birmingham---the-magic-city/#.UET9kMr13FU.facebook">Liverpool Biennial</a>,  running between 15th September–25th November, taking place in Liverpool (of course).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks back I <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/12/22/got-a-minute-to-fill-out-a-survey/">put up a survey</a> because I was interested in seeing which websites or online services people use to find out what’s going on around Birmingham.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had 100 submissions, which seems like a good place to draw things to a close and have a look at the results:</p>
<p><strong>Listings/what&#8217;s on</strong></p>

4 &#8211; Birmingham Gig Guide<br />
4 &#8211; What&#8217;s On Midlands (online)</p>
<p>Suggestions left in the &#8216;other&#8217; box included The Ticketsellers, Last.fm, Songkick, Ents24, Brum Notes, finditinbirmingham.com, More Canals Than Venice, The Wire and Upcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Arts/culture news</strong></p>

20 &#8211; Arts Council England Arts News<br />
15 &#8211; Audiences Central</p>
<p>Others included Ryan&#8217;s Gig Guide, An Craic, We Are Eastside and Area Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Who filled out the survey?</strong></p>
<p>We had a roughly 50:50 male/female split, a wide spread of ages (with a slight skew to 18-25 and 26-35) and pretty much everyone has a B postcode, with a smattering of WV and DY&#8217;s too.</p>
<p><strong>Any conclusions?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing really concrete, but it was interesting. I&#8217;ve got an idea of the level of web traffic of some of the sites listed, so I know that the results certainly doesn&#8217;t indicate which are the most popular websites around the city. However, you could say that this shows which other websites overlap with CiB&#8217;s readership.</p>
<p>If anything, I was expecting the Post &amp; Mail to come up a bit higher. Nice to see Live Brum up there.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out and/or forward on the survey.</p>

</ul>
<p>In addition the writer will have two half-day mentoring sessions with Sally O’Reilly which will focus on writing practice.</p>
<p>The writer will be expected to produce three pieces of critical writing (as detailed below), which will be published on <a href="http://www.thisistomorrow.info/" target="_blank">www.thisistomorrow.info</a> and <a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/" target="_blank">www.weareeastside.com</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A review of Flatpack or Fierce Festival (500words), March 2011</li>
<li>An interview/feature on a West Midlands based practitioner or artist-led organisation (1000 words), June 2011</li>

<p><a href="http://weareeastside.org/" target="_blank">We Are Eastside</a><strong> </strong> is a joint-venture of sixteen organisations, including <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID<strong>,</strong></a> <a href="http://www.eastsideprojects.org/">Eastside Projects</a><strong>,</strong><a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/"> Ikon Eastside</a>,  The<strong> </strong><a href="http://thelombardmethod.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Lombard Method</a> and<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/">7 Inch Cinema</a><strong>,</strong> coordinated by <a href="http://capsule.org.uk/" target="_blank">Capsule</a>, to link-up and expose the goings-on in the area, now dubbed Birmingham&#8217;s Creative Playground.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Underneath Eastside’s arches you’ll find a whole host of  organisations making and presenting film, music, visual arts, digital  media, craft, literature, and photography – and some great pubs and  cafes too. We Are Eastside is a guide to some of these hidden treasures.</p>
<p>Arts enthusiasts, film  and music fans, historians, city visitors and the downright curious from  across the West Midlands will have the opportunity to explore creative  work being produced in the area by taking in a film screening or magic  lantern show, experiencing live experimental jazz or electronica,  learning about pigeon fancying, training as a traditional jester or  clown or by attending the opening of a new gallery during three days of  activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>To coincide with We Are Eastside&#8217;s launch there are a load of events going on over the weekend. There&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/2010/03/eastside-projects-open-this-sunday/">Curtain Show</a> at Eastside Projects, the <a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/2010/03/east-stride/">East Stride walking tour</a>, <a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/2010/03/purple-ceiling-opening-25th-march-5-7pm/">Purple Ceiling</a> at The Lombard Method, and <a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/2010/03/gongoozler-opens-this-saturday-at-grand-union/">GONGOOZLER</a> at Grand Union, as well as a bunch of other interesting things.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/28858050/We-Are-Eastside-listings">I&#8217;ve posted the listings here</a> if you want to see what&#8217;s happening in full, but you can also <a href="http://weareeastside.org/">check out the We Are Eastside blog</a> for any changes and additions to the programme.</p>
<p>The blog looks like it&#8217;ll be an ongoing source of  regular updates, programmes, event information, opportunities and  contributions from the cluster of artists, collectives, promoters and  spaces based in the Eastside area, so you can keep an eye on it here: <a href="http://www.weareeastside.org/" target="_blank">www.weareeastside.org</a>.</p>
