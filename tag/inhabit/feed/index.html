<p>Some of you may already be aware of <a href="http://www.hybridconsulting.org.uk/projects/inhabit-vacant-spaces-vibrant-places">Inhabit</a> and their temporary, traveling tea shops. They held a small shop in Ladywood for ten weeks, but have since moved on to their next venture in Handsworth, which is due to open on 9 November.</p>
<p>The new shop will be located at 27 Grove Lane, and will have a string of free creative participatory events and the opportunity to work with commissioned artists on their projects set in the local community.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll also be inviting local residents to drop by for tea and cake. Informal drop-in sessions will be held weekly on Tuesdays 11am &#8211; 2pm and Fridays 2pm &#8211; 6pm.</p>
<p>Look out for more info on Inhabit, as they&#8217;ll be setting up camp in other key wards around the city, along with the Pavillions towards the end of November.</p>
<p>For more information on the project, email <a href="mailto:karen@hybridconsulting.org.uk">Karen Meng</a> or call <strong>0121 236 1669</strong></p>
