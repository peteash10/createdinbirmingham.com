				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks back there was <a href="http://scriptwm.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/the-challenge-of-change-how-can-we-create-a-better-future-for-theatre-here-in-the-west-midlands/">a meet-up of West Mids theatre folk</a> &#8211; the event was called The Challenge of Change and (from what I understand) there were two days of workshops and discussions  around the future of West Mids theatre.</p>
<p>Graeme Rose (<a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/toyorch">The Modified Toy Orchestra</a>, etc) has written up some <a href="http://graemerose.com/2009/11/27/the-challenge-of-change/">notes about the first day</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s talk of Action Plans coming out of the event but I&#8217;m yet to find anything online anywhere just yet. Until they turn up, I rather like this list of pledges sketched out by James Yarker (also of Stan&#8217;s Cafe):</p>
<ol>
<li>Attend 12 theatre shows in the next 12 months, 4 by West Midlands writers/artists/companies you haven’t seen before, 1 in a West Midlands Venue you’ve never been to before.</li>
<li>Take 12 people who have never been, rarely go, or don’t ‘do’ Independent Theatre to a show. Share transport.</li>
<li>Host a meal/party for 8 people 4 of which you barely know.</li>
<li>Write 12 comments/reviews/blog entries about theatre on other people’s sites.</li>
<li>Attend 1 mid*point or return to the next Open Space event.</li>
</ol>
<p>They seem like common sense things that you&#8217;d hope people would be doing anyway but probably aren&#8217;t by everyone. I&#8217;m sure very similar things could be drawn up for many different artforms. <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=435">James explains</a> where the pledges came from. It&#8217;d be nice if they really were written up in some formal way. <a href="http://yascapi.wordpress.com/2009/12/03/taking-the-pledge/">Michelle Knight</a> has opted in. Is anyone else prepared to be held to these? If not, how come?</p>
