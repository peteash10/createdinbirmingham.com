				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trove&#8217;s newest exhibition for 2013, <a title="Band / Ties" href="http://trove.org.uk/exhibitions/january-2013-band-ties/" target="_blank">Band / Ties</a>, sees two Birmingham based artists, Elly Clarke and Caitlin Griffiths, and two Stockholm based artists, Bjorn Karlsson and Hanna Ljungh, come together for an exhibition that focuses on relationships.</p>
<p>It looks at the relationships with people, places, families and communities. The artists involved explore where it is they belong, looking at where they&#8217;re from, or the communities they&#8217;re involved in and aims to forge links between the cities and between the artistic communities of these places. The natural connections and overlaps are made within all the works and new opportunities develop.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cross-overs, connections, ties and links can expose themselves at random moments.  Relationships can be born out of incidental meetings.</p></blockquote>
<p>The curators Charlie Levine (UK) and Suvi Lehtinen (Sweden) also met at a random moment during the summer through a mutual friend and curatorial partner, and this is when the idea of the exhibition was born.</p>
<p>The exhibition took place in Stockholm in December and will launch on January 23rd at 5pm till 7pm at <a title="Trove" href="http://trove.org.uk/" target="_blank">Trove in Birmingham</a> and run Monday &#8211; Friday until 20th February.</p>
