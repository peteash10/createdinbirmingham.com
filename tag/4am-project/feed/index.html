				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">So how many of you were awake at <a href="http://4amproject.org/2009/04/4am-on-4th-april/" target="_blank">4am on the 04/04/09</a>?  And how many of you visually documented that moment?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="well if i can get out of bed..." src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/3411785132_ee9be97c7e.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As was <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/04/07/4am-project/" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a> here on CiB, the <a href="http://4amproject.org/" target="_blank">4am Project</a> is the genius concept of <a href="http://www.karenstrunks.com/" target="_blank">Karen Strunks</a>, a Birmingham photographer who singlehandedly convinced thousands of strangers across the world that it would be a <em>great</em> idea to stay awake/get up at 4am to document that moment for no other reason than to be part of a larger group of people doing just that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And people, in their droves, agreed that it was a great idea and stayed up (or set their alarms, like me!) and took photographs and sent them to the 4am website, or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/4amproject" target="_blank">tagged them on Flickr</a> so that everyone could see a snapshot of the world, of <em>their</em> world, at such an uncomfortably late/early hour.  Who knew you could create such extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital" target="_blank">social capital</a> before breakfast?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36065798@N03/3619831921/"><img class="aligncenter" title="4ammap" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2428/3619831921_ec80b89112.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="244" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building upon the success of the previous event, 4am photos have continued to flood in, without being prompted to do so &#8211; and Karen has now decided it&#8217;s time to coordinate another 4am en masse.  The date of the next event is: <strong>21/06/09</strong>.  (And in case you somehow missed it, the time will be 4am, and the place will be wherever you are!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the 4am Project has been nominated for the <a href="http://digitalpressawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Digital Press Awards</a>, and if you think (like I do) that this project is a fab idea and a lot of fun, then vote for it to win!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A while back I mentioned a strange meet up named <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/02/25/creative-networks-barg-meet-ups/" target="_blank">BARG</a> happening in the back of an old pub in Digbeth  These meetings were for anyone with a creative mind or just a childlike desire to play, and looked at how we can use mobile technology and social media stuff to play interesting games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3593" title="barg1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg" alt="barg1" width="597" height="113" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg 597w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1-300x56.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These games, much like the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emergentgame.org.uk%2F&amp;ei=lQoCSuiBLJO7jAfS6vWCBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCpUVPvs2vikW9RIOFM29RHKwKWg&amp;sig2=CHgA-fRtUiic7FJq5Q4C9A" target="_blank">Emergent Game</a> a few years ago prove that interactive play doesn&#8217;t have to be homed exclusively online or in the playground but can explore geographical areas in new ways, look at how we now communicate online and off, and give a chance for grown adults to play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Nicky doing good work in the city is Nicky Getgood who writes the blog <a href="http://digbeth.org/" target="_blank">Digbeth is Good</a>. She uses social media stuff like maps, videos and games within her blog which demand importance in the real world and sets the context firmly within the geographical area and a real community. The most interesting projects I have seen recently rely on this process of interweaving online and offline participation, such as <a href="http://4amproject.org/" target="_blank">4am Project</a> and other activities like Flickr meetups which happen in the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now spring has sprung the BARG group are taking games onto the streets of Birmingham, with the aim of  taking a fresh look at neglected parts of the city, and reclaiming them much like how skateboarders do. This Saturday between 2pm and about 7pm they will be hosting an afternoon of play and picnics on Curzon Street. For more information and maps etc go to <a href="http://www.npugh.co.uk/blog/w_i_d_e_o_p_e_n_s_p_a_c_e/" target="_blank">Nikki&#8217;s personal blog.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">About a year ago <a href="http://www.karenstrunksphotographer.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Karen Strunks</a> came up with the crazy idea of getting out of bed and stepping out at 4am to photograph desolate streets and a sleeping city. A year on, the idea has grown into a fully fledged international event called <a href="http://4amproject.org/" target="_blank">4am Project</a>. The idea is spreading like wildfire, and it seems people <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/4amproject" target="_blank">all over the world</a> are getting in on the bleary-eyed party. On Thursday the Guardian profiled the project in their <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/gallery/2009/mar/26/4am-project-photography-travel?picture=344990181" target="_blank">Travel section</a>, featuring 4am photographs taken around the globe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #808080;"><span class="credit"><span style="color: #000000;">On Saturday 4th April 2009 photographers of all kinds will be dragging themselves out of bed and taking a picture of their world at 4am</span></span></span>.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: left;">It can be of anything at all. A self portrait, the room you’re in, the view from your window. Perhaps you want to venture out a bit further, maybe you’ll be travelling, or at work &#8211; maybe you’re a night owl…</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever you’re doing, it’d be great if you could get involved and play a part in building up a big picture of the world at 4am.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Get out there, take your photo and either <a href="mailto:4amproject@googlemail.com" target="_blank">email it to them</a> or upload to <a href="http://flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and tag with the word <strong>4amproject.</strong></p>
