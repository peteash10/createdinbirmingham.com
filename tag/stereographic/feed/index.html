<li><a href="http://www.stereographic.co.uk/blog/?p=41">stereographic » We are X</a><br />
Yet another 10th birthday &#8211; Sam and George from Stereographic are celebrating double figures</li>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/dec/13/2009-review-art-laura-cumming">2009 in review: Art &#8211; The Observer</a><br />
Ikon supplies the only non-London shows on the list. Good work</li>
<li><a href="http://brumcast.podomatic.com/entry/2009-12-15T03_50_29-08_00">Brumcast 142 ‘Festival Strength’</a><br />
I had a Brumcast binge on the way to Cornwall the other day (if CiB&#8217;s been quiet it&#8217;s cos I&#8217;ve been away) and it was all good stuff &#8211; I reckon the newer format of regular, shorter shows is working well. Here&#8217;s the latest installment</li>
<li><a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/the-sickly-trickle/">The Sickly Trickle « More Canals than Venice</a><br />
&#8220;From Thursday 17th to Saturday 19th TROVE present The Sickly Trickle, a solo exhibition of works from Bristol based artist Zoe Williams at the site of the Old Science Museum, 144 Newhall Street&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/what-is-the-community/">What is the community? |</a><br />
Friction Arts&#8217; Lee Griffiths had his goat got by community consultations, the idea of giving people what you think they want and the cult of youth. Nice to see someone with a point of view and also worth reading in the light of <a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/the-views-and-opinions-in-this-post-may-not-be-the-views-and-opinions-of-friction-arts-etc-etc/">his later post</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam from <a href="http://www.stereographic.co.uk/">Stereographic</a> has emailed with info about a couple of his projects:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrunderwood.co.uk/">Mr Underwood</a> (and various other names, depending on musical genres)<a href="http://www.mrunderwood.co.uk/"><br />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>a variety of projects from creating soundtracks and effects for animations to wowing crowds with his all hardware improvised liveset. When time permits he also dabbles in the design and build of obscure musical instruments</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2529" title="kal_initial" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kal_initial.jpg" alt="kal_initial" width="500" height="375" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kal_initial.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kal_initial-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://samski.net/">dotPlay();</a></p>
<p>A dumping ground for other bits and pieces including the effect of smearing vaseline on a camera lens, fun with kaleidoscopes (pic above) and a project called <a href="http://samski.net/?p=15">Your World</a>. For the latter, Sam says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I give you a disposable camera and a stamped addressed return envelope; you fill the camera with photos of Your World and send it back to me for processing</p></blockquote>

First Light&#8217;s blog has got off to a good start and now they&#8217;ve got a competition going. Have a look at one of the films they&#8217;ve funded and, by commenting on it, you can win yourself a poster</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stereographic.co.uk/blog/?p=34">stereographic Â» Plus+ 2008 &#8211; call for helpâ€¦</a><br />
Can anyone help Stereographic out?  They need:<br />
(1) a mannequin â€“ full sized / male or female. (If by any chance anyone has a reflective mannequin that would be a mega bonus!)<br />
(2) any â€˜discarded designâ€™ fellow designers / artists / companies have that they want to get rid of â€“ things like demo prints / failed pitch designs / overruns on brochures etc</li>
<li><a href="http://sarahgraphics.blogspot.com/2008/07/hello-my-name-is-sarah.html">WOW: Hello, my name is Sarah :)</a><br />
Sarah Carter is &#8220;a design student that loves branding and typography&#8221;.  She&#8217;s been working on Baskerville: The Animated Movie and did some live drawing at Re-Sketch at The Rainbow.  This is her blog</li>

Stereographic have posted up some new examples of their work on their blog (including their work for Birmingham Opera Company and New Art Gallery Walsall) but it&#8217;s things like Sam&#8217;s scribble diary here which I like seeing and gives more of an insight into what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes (monsters and beer, by the looks of it)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/2008/10/08/platform-video/">Platform 01</a><br />
&#8220;PLATFORM 01 was a multi-media collection of work by predominantly local artists, and featured contributions from painters, photographers, sculptors, printmakers and digital media artists&#8221;.  It was filmed in the Custard Factory Gallery</li>
<li><a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/2008/10/08/punch-winter-2008/">Punch Winter 2008</a><br />
Punch Record&#8217;s winter schedule is out</li>
<li><a href="http://athleticotorturedartistsfc.tumblr.com/">Athletico Tortured Artists FC</a><br />
This is brilliant (although apparently my hair is to tidy for me to ever get a call-up &#8211; fairy nuff)</li>
<li><a href="http://typedrawer.blogspot.com/">The Type Drawer</a><br />
&#8220;We are working on a scene whereby a magical Type drawer explains some of Baskerville&#8217;s and Birmingham&#8217;s industrial achievements&#8221; &#8216;We&#8217; being Sarah Carter, Howie Barker, Tommy Morrison and Alex Bermingham &#8211; the people behind this blog and a creative team working on Baskerville The Movie</li>

Stereographic have been working on a &#8220;brand and communications refresh&#8221; for the New Art Gallery Walsall and here&#8217;s some of what they&#8217;ve been producing</li>

&#8220;Regular performances in Symphony Hall are accompanied by international orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, often with world-class soloists&#8230; You donâ€™t have to be an expert or a great singer to join the Birmingham Bach Choir but you should be able to read music and to enjoy working hard with everyone else to achieve the high standards we look to maintain&#8221;</li>

<li><a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/aboutthersc/1297.aspx">Royal Shakespeare Company: Head of Digital Media</a><br />
Ok, slightly outside CiB&#8217;s geographical remit but I thought it was interesting &#8211; the RSC want someone who will (amongst other things) make &#8216;the web an integral part of the way we work and create a new accessible global venue for performance and other content&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://elisabethingram.blogspot.com/2008/06/spaghetti-junction-heamatite-rings.html">Elisabeth Ingram: Spaghetti Junction Heamatite Rings</a><br />
Nod to Bounder for this one.  A fascinating blog post from a jewellery designer who has made rings based on our favourite concrete tangle.</li>
