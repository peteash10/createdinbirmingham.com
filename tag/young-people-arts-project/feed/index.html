<p><a href="http://www.thepublic.com/">The Public art gallery</a> in West Bromwich has joined forces with <a href="http://www.itvfixers.com/">ITV  Fixers</a> to present an exhibition of works, including  painting, sculpture, photography and short film, by young and up-and-coming artists. Here&#8217;s the background:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fixer Todd Wooton (22) is a young artist. Throughout school and  university he has found it almost impossible to get his art seen. So he  has become a Fixer to sort it out. With the help of his Young  People’s Co-ordinator, Todd has organised for the work of about 17 young  aspiring artists to be exhibited at The Public, a community arts space,  in West Bromwich. The exhibition will last two weeks from 19th April  to 3rd May 2010 and will display pieces by undiscovered Midlands-based  artists.</p></blockquote>

A couple of the Audiences Central peeps have started their own blogs recently, with this one from Fiona likely to be the most, um, quirky. She has/had a secret obsession &#8211; rating the city&#8217;s (and likely other cities&#8217;) toilets. So far pubs and restaurants feature highly</li>
