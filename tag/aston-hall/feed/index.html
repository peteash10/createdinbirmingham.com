<p>Last weekend I went along to <a title="Aston Hall by candlelight" href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/events?id=1552">Aston Hall</a> for one of the candlelit tours they do at this time of year:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the country’s finest Jacobean houses, Aston Hall is seen at its most breathtaking, lit by around 300 shimmering candles and warmed by two glorious historic fireplaces</p></blockquote>
<p>It was pretty good too. It&#8217;s an amazing place and some of the actors that were dotted around were clearly having a lot of fun (especially one of the sword fighters at the beginning). I hadn&#8217;t realised what a big deal it was either &#8211; there were a lot of people booked in for each tour.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t make it along this year than apparently you&#8217;ll have to wait until 2013 for the next one. In the meantime, <a title="Video of Aston Hall by candlelight on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QB4u9I_0bU">here&#8217;s a video</a>:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The generally stress free holiday of Halloween presents an excuse for some thrilling fun for all ages. Here&#8217;s a run down of a few things going on in Birmingham;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Since Halloween falls on a weekend, it would be a crime to let an opportunity to get dressed up go unmentioned. Most weekend club nights will be welcoming heavy eyeliner and fake blood, on the only occasion where you can get away with wearing a bin liner, here&#8217;s a few that stand out;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two new things (to me, at least) gleaned from the arts bit of the BCC website. First up, <strong>Verbalise</strong> which culminates in a performance on Thurs 3 June:</p>
<blockquote><p>A celebration of young people’s written and spoken words. Verbalise  showcases the talents of Birmingham’s emerging spoken word artists and  performance poets, kicking off with a series of Saturday afternoon  workshops led by renowned spoken word artist <a href="http://www.homeofpolar.com/">PolarBear</a>. Verbalise  culminates in two days of performances, in and around Birmingham City  Centre and appearances as part of the <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/youngreaders">Young Readers festival</a> in  Birmingham Central Library and at <a title="Aston Hall" href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/aston-hall">Aston Hall</a>’s Book Bash.</p></blockquote>
<p>And <strong>Visualise</strong>, which is slated for the end of October 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its heart will be a major open visual arts competition for young  people of all ages, to be hosted in a high profile city centre venue.  The festival will also offer the chance to see the work of other arts  and community organisations from across the city, working with young  people and the visual arts.</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/jobs/listing/?id=1296">coordinator is needed</a> for that one, if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
