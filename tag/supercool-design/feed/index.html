				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drum roll please&#8230;.Congratulations to Katie Parry of <a href="http://twitter.com/supercoolkp" target="_blank">Supercool design</a> who has won the Created in Birmingham design competition with this fantastic graphic map of Brum. The decision was made by myself and Kay at Cut-Out shop, and we thought the design was simple, beautiful  and fulfilled the brief to a T.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3659/3339577114_dda1affeb8.jpg?v=0" alt="" width="399" height="500" /></p>
<p>The design will be lovingly screenprinted by hand onto high quality t-shirts and canvas bags by up and coming DiY print shop <a href="http://www.cutoutshop.com/" target="_blank">Cut-Out</a> who are based in the West Midlands. The items will be sold via Cut-Out and will be strictly limited edition. All profits made from the items will be donated in <a href="http://www.acorns.org.uk/" target="_blank">Acorn Children&#8217;s Hospice</a>. I will be meeting with Kay to thrash out the details in the next week so I will let you know anymore details then.</p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone who has taken the time to enter the competition, there has been a smorgasbord of different styles submitted and every one of them was thoughtfully put together from the brief. I will post some of them up in the next few days.</p>
