				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I could never draw much more than a stick man on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch">Etch-a-Sketch</a> but as part of <a href="http://www.thebigdraw.org/bigdraw/">The Big Draw</a>, <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a> have been inviting people to show off their knob-twizzling skills and produce Etch-a-Sketch artwork for <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/event/re-sketch">Re:sketch</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/event/re-sketch"><img class="size-full wp-image-10599 aligncenter" title="Re_sketch" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Re_sketch.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="350" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Re_sketch.jpg 481w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Re_sketch-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></a></p>
<p>And the creativity hasn&#8217;t been restricted to the classic etch-a-sketch picture, as artists have been actively encouraged to paint and take apart their red framed tablets to create something new.</p>
<p>All of the artworks will be displayed in a public exhibition between 1-16 October and the deadline for submissions is 5pm, 27 September 2011, so there&#8217;s still time to get etching. For details on how to get involved, contact <a href="mailto:learning@macarts.co.uk">learning@macarts.co.uk</a>.</p>
