				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was really touched by what Chris wrote about Baldy&#8217;s Blog in his <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/01/15/created-in-birmingham-best-uk-blog-2008/#comments" target="_blank">thank you post</a> last Thursday. It got me thinking that if we could harness the huge support of the creative community which made it possible for CiB to win an award, what could we do if we used that support within project which would affect people who need it most, for example a charity?</p>
<p>When I was looking at Ben Javens&#8217;s website shop yesterday I had a flash of inspiration. Here is my idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brum&#8217;s best known 2D artists donate an original image, drawing, photograph etc. to CiB</li>
<li>CiB sets up an online shop using a website service  like <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Press</a>.<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/" target="_blank"><br />
</a></li>
<li>CiB sells limited edition t shirts,  canvas bags, pin badges etc which sport the original images</li>
<li>All the profits go to a Birmingham based charity suggested by you, the CiB readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that is the bare bones of an idea which could be made into a rather nice charity project, with a bit of your help. What I am asking you, the readers is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would anyone like to offer an image / illustration to be used?</li>
<li>Can anyone recommended a Cafe Press type service?</li>
<li>Most importantly: What Birmingham based charity could the proceeds go to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answers in  the comments please! Any other ideas / comments gratefully received.</p>
