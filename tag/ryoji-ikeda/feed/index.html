				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As threatened previously, I did  pop over to Ikon Eastside on Friday lunchtime. The current installation is by <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/339/ryoji_ikeda/">Ryoji Ikeda and is called <em>data.tron</em></a>, part of:</p>
<blockquote><p>his exploration of the infinity of data between 0 and 1, an abstraction of reality that challenges our perception of the codes present in everyday life</p></blockquote>
<p>It was quite nice and sunny on Friday afternoon, so stepping off Fazeley Street and walking straight into a pitch black space was a little disconcerting. Especially with no-one else around, the air filled with a high-pitched whine and clicking with the large wall at the far end taken up by a projection of streaming data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg" rel="lightbox[3984]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3985" title="Ryoji Ikeda" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg" alt="Ryoji Ikeda" width="450" height="300" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg 450w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>For a second it all felt a little too Poltergeist/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28film%29">Ring</a>-esque &#8211; I half expected Sadako to start crawling towards me. That didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>What looked like white noise from a distance turned out to be precisely determined; calculated data with it&#8217;s own, very particular, order (albeit one I couldn&#8217;t make out &#8211; but I&#8217;m happy to accept it&#8217;s there). Interesting, then.</p>
<p><em>data.tron</em> will be at Ikon Eastside until 8 November, while on 24 November there&#8217;ll be an audio-visual concert &#8211; <em><a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/348/datamatics_ver20/">datamatics [ver 2.0]</a></em> &#8211; by Ryoji Ikeda at the CBSO Centre, hosted by <a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/">BCMG</a>.</p>
<p>The work will also form the backdrop of <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/352/onoff/">Ikon Eastside&#8217;s closing party</a> on 12 November:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dress code is black and white, lights and atmosphere will be suitably monochrome, music and bands organised in collaboration with <a href="http://wearecolour.com/">Colour</a></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of all the things on last night I only made it to two out of five. I missed out on the opening of <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/339/ryoji_ikeda/">Ryoji Ikeda&#8217;s exhibition at Ikon Eastside</a> (which I might go and catch at lunchtime today), Jordan McKenzie&#8217;s &#8216;Day Into Night&#8217; at <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">Vivid</a> and <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/10/09/foxcolourruth-green/">Colour&#8217;s night at The Victoria</a> featuring World of Fox&#8217;s album launch.</p>
<p>Still, I did make it along to the <a href="http://www.artsandbusiness.org.uk/News/2009/Jul_Sep/mid_jag_lr_awards.aspx">Arts &amp; Business Awards</a>. The special guest was Patrick Stewart (who walked, not teleported on stage &#8211; disappointing) and the winners were:</p>
<ul>

<li>Cultural Branding Award &#8211; Stan&#8217;s Cafe &amp; AE Harris (Birmingham) Ltd</li>
<li>Museum, Libraries and Archives Award &#8211; Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust &amp; Inchscape Motors Shrewsbury</li>

<li>Business Volunteer of the Year Award &#8211; Colin Wells from Prologic plc &amp; Multistory (also winner of the Champion of Champions Award)</li>
</ul>
<p>Congrats to all of them.</p>
<p>After that I wandered down to the Sunflower Lounge for <a href="http://galleryofowls.org/news/all-you-can-eat-zine/">Gallery of Owl&#8217;s &#8216;All You Can Eat Zine&#8217;</a> which was fantastic &#8211; billed as &#8216;a night of Zines, comics, small press, music and performance&#8217;. It provided all of that as well as a palpable sense of</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stay for that long, but long enough to catch <a href="http://www.richardpeel.com/">Richard Peel</a>&#8216;s entertaining performance of Dracula, have a chat with Claire from <a href="http://www.attagrrl.co.uk/">ATTA grrl</a> a buy a couple of zines (ATTA grrl and Girls Who Draw, since you asked). There was a good turnout, a great atmosphere and the excitement of knowing there&#8217;s loads of interesting stuff going on around the city.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I picked up:</p>
