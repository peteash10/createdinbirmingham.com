<p>The highlights for this year&#8217;s <a title="Flatpack Festival" href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack Festival</a> are being released bit by bit on their website. As ever, the few things I&#8217;ve heard of are very good and I&#8217;m fully prepared to believe that things I&#8217;ve never heard of will be just as wonderful.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, for the first time since I&#8217;ve been aware of the film festival (now in its 6th year), I&#8217;m probably going to be in Birmingham the weekend it&#8217;s happening. That means I should play slightly more attention than I usually do to the programme. Recommendations gratefully received.</p>
