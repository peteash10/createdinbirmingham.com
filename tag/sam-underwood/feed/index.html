				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/night/birmingham/">Pecha Kucha</a> is an evening of people giving presentations. Stick with me though:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drawing its name from the Japanese term for the sound of &#8220;chit chat&#8221;, it rests on a presentation format that is based on a simple idea: 20 images x 20 seconds. It&#8217;s a format that makes presentations concise, and keeps things moving at a rapid pace.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the office dwellers reading this that last bit probably sounds like a blessed relief. People tend to use the opportunity to delve into a particular obsession that&#8217;s Any road, it&#8217;s a global thing and there&#8217;s a Birmingham one that&#8217;s coming up to it&#8217;s fifth edition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just been flicking through <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/pknbham">the archive of previous presentations</a> (filmed by <a href="http://www.mindriotproductions.co.uk/">Mindriot Productions</a>) and particularly enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/24231724">John Kirriemuir: &#8216;Goodbye Birmingham&#8217; or &#8216;What is home&#8217;?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/19534678">Helga Henry: Fear of public speaking</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/19533190">Sam Underwood</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;re only short so give em a spin.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/johardybrum">Jo Hardy</a> is the organiser, so if you fancy having a go then get in touch with her. Birmingham&#8217;s Pecha Kucha has a <a href="https://twitter.com/pechakucha_bham">Twitter account here</a> and <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/night/birmingham/">a website here</a>.</p>
<p>The next one will be on 20 July. I&#8217;m thinking about putting myself forward as a presenter but don&#8217;t quite know what I might talk about. I have a feeling it&#8217;d probably be about free kicks. Hmm.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April the 1<sup>st</sup> this year I will be embarking on a yearlong sabbatical from the company I co-run, <a href="http://www.stereographic.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stereographic</a>,  in order to concentrate on my music and arts projects. I have my  personal reasons for taking this step now but many of the broader  reasons are valid for anyone deciding to undertake a sabbatical. The  benefits to the creative-minded can be immense, so where better to  highlight them than here?</p>
<p>First,  let’s start by defining the term sabbatical. I’m with Wikipedia on this  and would simply define it as “a rest from work, a hiatus, lasting from  two months to a year”. I wouldn’t elaborate on this myself, as the key  to a sabbatical is simply to have a break from work, from the everyday.  For me, these are some of the major benefits of doing so:</p>
<p><strong>Freshness</strong></p>
<p>Our  brains are great at organising stuff and providing near instant,  ingrained responses. That’s a really important ability to help us  function as human beings. Clearly you don’t want to think “what’s that  noise?” every time your phone rings, or spend ages assessing the options  for dodging that bus.</p>
<p>The  more we do the same things the more ingrained our responses become.  This is a real killer where creativity is concerned. If you make a  concerted effort to regularly change stuff around in your life then you  can guarantee greater freshness of ideas, but in all honesty, how many  of you have deliberately done something that scares you recently?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ponder o’clock</strong></p>
<p>This one is simple; time to think about nothing in particular aids creativity. “Aha! moments” require a wandering mind.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>
<p>Building  processes to “keep it real” into your daily routine is a start but I  believe a truer perception of what you do and aim to achieve is only  possible through a sustained period of time off work. The perspective  gained through this can only be trumped by one thing in life, trauma…and  I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Time to make THOSE ideas happen</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://the99percent.com/" target="_blank">The 99%</a> are right in their slogan “It’s not about ideas. It’s about making them  happen.” Creative people tend to have lots of ideas for lots of great  projects they could bring to fruition, if only they had the time. Have a  quick think about your ideas that fit this description. The world would  be a better place if they saw the light of day, right?</p>
<p><strong>New opportunities &amp; relationships</strong></p>
<p>Less  time in the office / studio means more time meeting new people. Unless  you decide to lock yourself in a box for the entirety of your sabbatical  this is pretty much a given and good things will come of it!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Financial reward</strong></p>
<p>As  an artist/creative you are rewarded for the quality of your ideas and  your passion to make them happen. If you are passionate about what you  do, you’ll come back to it &#8211; only bigger, better and with renewed ideas  and drive!</p>
<p><strong>Life is (very) short!</strong></p>
<p>Take  two minutes to think about what you are doing with your life. Let’s  assume you broadly like it. OK, why not get better at it? Or, if in the  end you find there’s something out there you’d rather be doing instead  then that’s cool too. The key is to give yourself the space to consider  this properly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>After all that…just watch this</strong></p>
<p>Still  not convinced? Think it’s unworkable? Think the financial reward bit is  just a red herring? Then, please spend 17.5 minutes watching a lecture  delivered by the designer Stefan Sagmeister, at TED in 2009. Says it  all…</p>
