				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Call for Participants: The slightest movement, Fierce &amp; Quarantine</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.qtine.com">Quarantine</a>, in partnership with <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a>, are hosting a project entitled <a href="http://www.qtine.com/future/">The Slightest Movement</a>, bringing together groups of strangers to create a temporary community which openly debates difference, exploring tolerance and &#8216;otherness&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The task is repeated every day for a week.  Each day the event is  re-invented according to what happened the day before.  A small group  grows into a large one, gathering more and more strangers into a  temporary &#8211; perhaps uneasy &#8211; community.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slightest movement will take place 20-25 September in West Bromwich, and are inviting a core group of 15 people, both artists and non-artists, irrespective of background and experience to join this project. If you fancy getting involved, apply using the application via their website <a href="http://www.qtine.com/">www.qtine.com</a> by 3 September.</p>
<p><strong>Autumn Exhibition Opportunity &#8211; Call for Designer Makers, Brilliantly Birmingham</strong></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.brilliantlybirmingham.com/">Brilliantly Birmingham</a> festival is taking place  27 November 2010 – 9 January 2011, and is set to visit a variety of venues across the city, including the Flux exhibition of contemporary jewellery design at the <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A dynamic and ambitious exhibition of  new and emerging designer makers will promote challenging and diverse  new work, create a marketplace and contribute to the city as a visitor  attraction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flux is currently open to submissions from emerging designer makers based in the UK, who are no more than five years out of graduation. There&#8217;s no exhibition fee, but submissions have a £20 admin fee.</p>
<p>Application packs can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.brilliantlybirmingham.com/">www.brilliantlybirmingham.com</a> and must be submitted by 3 September.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a few jewellery-related things on at the moment. <a href="http://www.brilliantlybirmingham.com/">Brilliantly Birmingham</a> is ongoing until 21 December (although it&#8217;s a little hard to tell what&#8217;s happening and where from the website) and now there&#8217;s a new website for <a href="http://www.schoolofjewellery.co.uk/">BCU&#8217;s School of Jewellery</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/school-of-jewellery.jpg" rel="lightbox[2361]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2362" title="school-of-jewellery" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/school-of-jewellery.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="377" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/school-of-jewellery.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/school-of-jewellery-300x226.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the RSS feed for the news is practically invisible and doesn&#8217;t work anyway.</li>
<li>how about giving the students run of the news or an associated blog? There must be so much jewellery-related stuff happening in this city that&#8217;s going unreported and that&#8217;s as much a shame as it is an opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Brilliantly Birmingham is:</p>
<blockquote><p>showcases the work of local, national and international designer makers through a full programme of exhibitions, workshops and special events. All exhibitions are free of charge and the festival promises to be a fascinating insight into jewellery-making today</p></blockquote>
<p>will take place at a variety of venues across the city and region from 28th November 2008 â€“ 21st December 2008.</p>
<p>Incidentally, is there anyone regularly blogging (or reporting in any way) about jewellery in Birmingham?Â  I&#8217;ve not spotted anyone on my wanderings and would love to know if I&#8217;ve missed someone.</p>
