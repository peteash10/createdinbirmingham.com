<blockquote><p>At long last The Drum is launching â€œ<strong>Young Gifted Brum</strong>&#8220;, a free and continuous program of performing and digital arts for Children and Young People.</p>
<p>The launch will take place on Thursday, 6th November at 5.30pm â€“ 7.30pm at The Drum, Aston and all Young People aged 8-18yrs are welcome to come along if they are interested in Singing, Dance, Music, Digital Art, Acting and Spoken Word to find out what will be on offer in the coming months. They do not have to have any experience and it is not just open to people who want to perform. There will be an opportunity to <strong>showcase your talents at two annual events</strong>, whether your talents lie in producing, writing, directing, delivering events or performing in them.</p>
<p>There will also be a free â€œTaster Sessionâ€ that will take place at The Drum on Saturday, 8th November between 12pm and 4pm.</p>
<p>For more information please contact Dee on (0121) 333 2431</p></blockquote>
<p>Taken from the <a href="http://www.artsjobs.org.uk/index.php?id=25&amp;ne_source=dailynews_plain&amp;ne_post_id=10593">Arts Council&#8217;s free mailing list</a>, which is free and worth making use of.Â  I imagine it goes to quite a lot of people nationwide and it&#8217;d be great to have plenty of Birmingham (and other West Mids) stuff on it.</p>
