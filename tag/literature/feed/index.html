				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.writingwestmidlands.org/">Writing West Midlands</a> support creative writers and creative writing throughout the region and this Tuesday sees the launch of their rebrand, the introduction of their Literary Map and their first event of the season. You are invited to join Writing West Midlands for an evening of conversation and performance hosted by writer, broadcaster and WWM patron Stuart Maconie. There will be three literary guests joining Stuart, <a title="Judith Allnatt" href="http://www.judithallnatt.co.uk" target="_blank">Judith Allnatt</a>, <a title="Liz Berry" href="http://lizberrypoetry.co.uk" target="_blank">Liz Berry</a> and <a title="Ian Marchant" href="http://ianmarchant.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Ian Marchant</a> as well as live music from guitarist Paul Murphy formerly of the Balkan Gypsy group The Destroyers.</p>
<p>The event will run 7.30pm &#8211; 9.00pm, Tuesday 1st April at The Library of Birmingham and tickets are £6-8 available <a title="Writing West Midlands Event" href="http://www.birmingham-box.co.uk/event/stuart-maconie-and-friends" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Writing West Midlands will also introduce their Literary Map of the West Midlands that highlights the talent across the region. The map was designed/illustrated by <a href="http://www.kerryleslie.com/">Kerry.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>We commissioned the map because it&#8217;s our ambition to make sure the West Midlands is known as a writer&#8217;s region. We&#8217;re passionate about celebrating the writing of the West Midlands, both past and present.</p></blockquote>
