				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/whatson_focus.asp?showid=1717">iD is a show by Cirque Eloize</a>, a contemporary circus outfit from Montreal that&#8217;s coming over to Birmingham Hippodrome from 2-5 November. I met the company back in May and <a href="http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/2011/07/that-video-of-me-with-the-cyclist/">have explained why here</a>.</p>
<p>The performers in the show are phenomenal (and nice folks too) so as well as doing interviews and things I tried out a bit of trampolining and juggling with them. I also suggested they use me for one of the routines that trial biker Thibault Phillipe performs. We videoed it and the Hippodrome stuck it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sva-RwmOcgE">on their YouTube account</a> the other day.</p>
<p>At the time of typing, the video&#8217;s racked up 157,00 views. It&#8217;s also been picked up by <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504784_162-20076919-10391705.html">CBS News</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/05/reporter-chris-unitt-bike-stunt-volunteer_n_890204.html">The Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://thedailywh.at/2011/07/04/dont-move-of-the-day/#disqus_thread">The Daily What</a>, <a href="http://wabc.typepad.com/thetrend/2011/07/little-richard-justin-bieber-and-one-brave-reporter.html">ABC Eyewitness News</a> and <a href="http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/blike-cycling-blog/2011/07/video-cirque-eloize-trick-ride.html">The Mirror</a> so far.  I&#8217;m pretty chuffed with that.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sva-RwmOcgE">me putting myself in peril for your amusement</a>:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The issue of local TV has cropped up again recently.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back <a href="http://talkaboutlocal.org.uk/shott-review">Will Perrin put some thoughts down</a>, responding to government plans to encourage the development of up to twenty new local TV stations by 2015. The general gist of his post (although I&#8217;d encourage you to read it) was that there&#8217;s no need, it won&#8217;t work and, besides, the web would do the job better.</p>
<p><a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2010/08/27/what-would-you-show-from-birmingham-to-demonstrate-how-the-web-can-do-local-better-than-local-tv/">Nick Booth has built on this</a> and claims that Birmingham&#8217;s informal, fledgling network of local, mainly volunteer-led news websites shows that people are already delivering the kind of activity Jeremy Hunt says he wants to encourage using TV stations (see Nick&#8217;s post for details).</p>
<p>My generally unconsidered view on this is that establishing a local TV station wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be a <em>bad</em> thing &#8211; if someone (and I think <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/City-TV-Birmingham/154372226419">City TV</a> are still looking to get involved) can make the finances stack up and run something that doesn&#8217;t depend on handouts then great. It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be a particularly forward-thinking thing to spend public cash on.</p>
<p>If money/time/effort/attention/whatever is going to be spent on local media, I&#8217;d rather it was spent on getting people using the web and using it better &#8211; helping them access local information and publishing it themselves. There&#8217;s no reason video can&#8217;t be part of that &#8211; see I Am Birmingham for an example of someone using a <a href="http://www.iambirmingham.blogspot.com/">website with a free template</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/IAmBirmingham">YouTube account</a> to do regular-ish video content.</p>
<p>Also in the web&#8217;s favour &#8211; costs and barriers to entry are lower and the skills required are more readily transferrable. It&#8217;s also relevant to the government&#8217;s current strategy of closing down public services and replacing them with websites (Jobcentre Plus, Business Link and so on).</p>
<p>The whole &#8216;more TV by 2015&#8217; thing bothers me too. 2015 is five years off. Bear in mid that YouTube is only five years old and you get a sense of  how much things could change in the intervening years.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel I&#8217;m starting to edge slightly further away from CiB-land now. If you want to get involved in the debate then see what people are saying on <a href="http://talkaboutlocal.org.uk/shott-review">Will</a> and <a href="http://podnosh.com/blog/2010/08/27/what-would-you-show-from-birmingham-to-demonstrate-how-the-web-can-do-local-better-than-local-tv/">Nick</a>&#8216;s posts.</p>

<p>Well, wonder no more, because those enterprising chaps at <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/index.htm">The Electric</a><a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/index.htm"> cinema</a> have been busy making a fine selection of documentary videos which give a unique insight into the inner workings of the cinema, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/electricbham#p/c/ED2DBC480A56D242/10/CnZmQU4n3Wg">the lost art of cinema organists</a>, to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/electricbham#p/c/ED2DBC480A56D242/12/8dU-7fNvoFU">the journey into the third dimension</a>.</p>
<p>The clips have been lovingly crafted by the cinema&#8217;s owner and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/electricbham#p/c/ED2DBC480A56D242/3/ku2Xd2Ptlkc">lead guitarist</a> Tom Lawes, and I found myself absorbed by them, so set a few minutes aside to give them a watch. All the videos are on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/electricbham">the cinema&#8217;s Youtube channel</a>, but as a taster, here&#8217;s The Electric&#8217;s guide to 35mm projection:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All Consuming Love (Man in a Cat) is one of the short films commissioned for <a href="http://www.digishorts.co.uk/">Digishorts</a>. Louis Hudson, who makes up <a href="http://www.diceproductions.co.uk/">Dice Productions</a>&#8216; animation team, is now hard at work turning a preview/trailer into a fully fledged film.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is how he&#8217;s using <a href="http://www.youtube.com/allconsuminglove">a YouTube channel to upload little work-in-progress snippets</a> so you can see how he works and how the piece is coming along. Hoping he can keep this up.</p>
<p>In other Digishorts news, three of the filmmakers are <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/news/detail/874/call_out_for_short_film_producers/">looking for producers</a> for their commissioned films.</p>
