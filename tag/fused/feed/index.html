&#8220;We are extremely proud to announce that Capsule have been appointed to curate the Library of Birmingham’s opening ‘Discovery’ season.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://brummiesguidetobirmingham.blogspot.co.uk/">A Brummies Guide to Birmingham</a><br />
&#8220;I’ve set this blog up really to document my mini adventures around my home city; to promote the good bad and the ugly parts of it; to give a sense of what goes in on in Brum, from the city centre to the suburbs I call home&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://battyeblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/blp-brb-workshop.html">Richard Battye Photographer BLOG: BLP / BRB workshop</a><br />
Last night I had the pleasure of running a workshop for Birmingham Loves Photographers at the request of Craig Bush who is doing great things in the city for the photography community.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/fusedmagazine/status/207870003343671297">Twitter / Fusedmagazine</a><br />
&#8220;We&#8217;re organising a design and illustration festival in Autumn. Wanna know more/get involved kerry [@] http://fusedmagazine.com&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamcsp.org.uk/">Birmingham Community Safety Partnership</a><br />
I filled this out because walking through the city centre feels increasingly like that bit in Gladiators where contestants had to run down a channel trying to avoid being blocked by people who were all muscles and lycra. And who wants that?</li>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d have a root around for a few others.</p>
<p><a href="http://eyethief.blogspot.com/">Rajmeena</a> posts sketches, there are dribs and drabs on the <a href="http://www.retailbirmingham.co.uk/category/blog/">Retail Birmingham blog</a>, <a href="http://wecreate.org.uk/">We Create</a> have a blog that occasionally features &#8216;about young British fashion designers&#8217; although not so much recently. <a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/">LABB Magazine&#8217;s blog</a> goes in for loads of pics. <a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/">Fused</a> cover fashion from time to time too.</p>
<p>Selina Jervis is from Birmingham but not around the city so much as far as I can tell. Her <a href="http://flyingsaucer.typepad.com/">Flying Saucer blog</a> has been popular for a while and it&#8217;s interesting to see they&#8217;ve recently snapped her up as a guest blogger on <a href="http://www.browsebullring.co.uk/blogs/">Browse Bullring</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers to <a href="http://twitter.com/jim_b">Jim</a> for pointing me towards <a href="http://vintagereflection.wordpress.com/">Vintage Reflection</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually a little tricky to find out about local music around the city, I find. This is the stuff I know about, feel free to add other stuff in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>News</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.brumnotes.com/">Brum Notes</a> is the website for the free, monthly music and lifestyle magazine (Nov issue out now, <a href="http://issuu.com/brumnotesmagazine/docs/october">Oct one online here</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/music-in-birmingham/">Birmingham Post have news and reviews here</a> and the Birmingham Mail do <a href="http://www.birminghammail.net/what-is-on-in-birmingham/rock-and-pop/">rock/pop news</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/">Fused Magazine</a>&#8216;s site does the odd bit of music news, as does the website for sister magazine <a href="http://areamagazine.wordpress.com/">Area</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surgemusic.com/">Surge Music</a> takes a wider, Midlands-wide view of things, with articles and lists of gigs, bands and venues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.culdesaconline.com/">Cul-de-Sac</a> turned out to be a false dawn for this sort of thing, but may come back one day.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/birminghamlive">@birminghamlive</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/brumpunks">@brumpunks</a> are good sources for concert info too.</p>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.brumlive.com/">Birmingham Live</a> is the obvious choice here &#8211; someone from their ranks of volunteer reviewers and photographers will be at a gig in Birmingham pretty much every evening. <a href="http://stevegerrardphotography.com/blog/">Steve Gerrard</a> organises this one (<a href="http://www.leeallenphotography.com/">Lee Allen</a> and I have also chipped in occasionally).</p>
<p><a href="http://thehearingaid.blogspot.com/">The Hearing Aid</a> is a blog by someone called The Baron who goes to an impressive number of local gigs.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birminghammail.net/what-is-on-in-birmingham/birmingham-gig-reviews/">Birmingham Mail do gig reviews</a> too.</p>
<p><strong>Get-togethers</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/">Birmingham Music Network</a> meets monthly at the Department of Technology, Engineering and the Environment (T.E.E.) at Millennium Point. Their website has a good range of resources too.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m on shakier ground here &#8211; which radio shows promote local talent There&#8217;s <a href="http://brumcast.podomatic.com/">Brumcast</a> on <a href="http://www.rhubarbradio.com/">Rhubarb Radio</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2007/07/12/daz_hale_introduces_feature.shtml">Introducing on BBC WM</a>. I don&#8217;t know enough about the shows on <a href="http://www.newstyleradio.co.uk/">New Style Radio</a>, <a href="http://www.astonfm.com/astonFM/Default.htm">Aston FM</a> or any others.</p>
<p>Are there any Birmingham-based mp3 blogs worth talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Anything else?</strong></p>
<p>Let me know in the comments. Just to be clear, we&#8217;re not looking for bands/venues/promoters to plug themselves but if that&#8217;s you, where do you look to get featured?</p>
<p>Oh, and see also <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/10/12/birmingham-listings-websites/">Birmingham listings</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of music-related things came out over the weekend both adding up to paint a less than rosy picture of Birmingham&#8217;s current live music scene.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="The Rainbow, Digbeth by ell brown, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ell-r-brown/4001545606/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2572/4001545606_b5352b4485.jpg" alt="The Rainbow, Digbeth" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://interactivecultures.org/music-as-culture/music-as-culture-online">Interactive Cultures</a> team at BCU have launched <a href="http://musicasculture.org/">MusicAsCulture.org</a> &#8211; a place to discuss the idea that &#8216;music is not just commerce&#8217;. It&#8217;s not an exclusively local thing, but it launches with a Birmingham-focussed  campaign dealing with the noise issues at The Rainbow in Digbeth. The campaign is being headed up by UB40 and is called Live, Loud and Local:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here in Birmingham, as with many places elsewhere, heritage music venues are in danger of closure or losing their live music licence because of issues of noise. Areas that were once not residential now have tenants, and the clash between apartment dwellers and local music venues has demanded a response at a policy level</p></blockquote>
<p>UB40 will be playing a one-off gig at The Rainbow on 3 November to raise money for a new roof on the building in an attempt to reduce outside noise. I don&#8217;t know where you can get tickets from yet, but then nor do <a href="http://www.ub40.co.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=101266&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=50&amp;sid=5f7ee57f56d3fb52d216c302143863fc">the folks on the UB40 forum</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/2009/10/09/johnny-foreigner/">Fused interviewed Johnny Foreigner</a> who aren&#8217;t afraid of sticking the boot in. They&#8217;re working on a documentary about how Birmingham&#8217;s music scene &#8220;suffers as a result when compared to other major cities&#8221;, which they see as a result of neglect by the council. Their advice for the city:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Drop the ego like Liverpool or nurture the homegrown stuff like Leeds and see the results in five years time when there are famous and forward looking bands not ashamed to say where they’re from</span></strong></p></blockquote>
