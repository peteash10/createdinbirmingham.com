				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A message that went up on <a href="http://www.taktak.net">Tak</a>&#8216;s website last month confirming the news that had been doing the rounds for a little while:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of July 2010 &#8211; exactly six years from the day they opened &#8211; we closed the doors at TAK! Towers to explore new ideas &amp; ventures. It&#8217;s been fun, thanks for having us!</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Tak had been responsible for the <a href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/">Home of Metal</a> website, the branding for <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/">British Dance Edition</a> and had picked up a run of awards for their work on <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/">BMAG&#8217;s Pre-Raphaelite website</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve just heard (<a href="http://twitter.com/animationforum/status/20700382410">via Dave Allen</a>) that <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/">Script</a>, the West Mids agency for dramatic writers, are shutting up shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with great regret and reluctance that the Board of Script has taken the decision to dissolve the company as of the end of August 2010.</p>
<p>The loss of RFO status in March 2008 has had a serious impact on the company&#8217;s resources, and the reliance on ever-decreasing pots of project funding has made its future existence unsustainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/home_news.html">Script&#8217;s August newsletter</a> for further info and to see a slew of opportunities for writers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Personal Portfolio 1 - BMAG" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3403/3662967462_f873637d32.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="316" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve often wondered why museums and galleries aren&#8217;t using their web presence in more innovative and useful ways.  I worked within a gallery for a number of years, and this gave me the unsurprising insight that many factors contributed to this: underpaid overworked staff, simply no capacity (in terms of time) to explore new avenues, gallery staff restricted to working within strictly defined roles with little room for experimentation, and those who do maintain the web side of things being under supported and in need of upskilling.  Plus above all, there are many challenges facing gallery collections (from conservation to valuation to interpretation and beyond) that the additional pressure of creating new ways of accessing that information sits at the bottom of anyone&#8217;s agenda, particularly when it could just end up as a copyright/intellectual property/Digital Rights Management nightmare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a> have been brave enough to tackle these issues head on with the decision to publicly release their world-class <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/" target="_blank">Pre-Raphaelite collection</a>, the largest in Europe, becoming the focal point for this work.  With assistance from <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><span class="caps">JISC</span></a>, <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/" target="_blank">BMAG</a> appointed Birmingham-based digital agency <a href="http://www.taktak.net/" target="_blank"><span class="caps">TAK</span>!</a> after a five way pitch to design and develop a website application to achieve their goal.  And the <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/" target="_blank">resulting site</a> is a beautiful, delicate and sensitive piece of design.  Visitors will be able to access high quality content which will enable schools, universities, and the general public to have a greater understanding of the collection in their own time, and in their own space &#8211; which in turn could encourage new visitors and raise the profile of the museum.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<a href="http://www.taktak.net/" target="_blank">TAK!</a> have helped us create the largest <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/" target="_blank">online Pre-Raphaelite collection</a> in the world” concludes Linda Suprdle, Project Manager at <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/" target="_blank"><span class="caps">BMAG</span></a>. “It’s a fantastic resource and provides an unparalleled level of access and quality to the works on display. Anyone with an interest in art should visit the site and discover the importance of the Pre-Raphaelites.”</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope that this project will encourage other museums and galleries to consider making their collections accessible online.  They have the opportunity to create such valuable learning resources which could cross so many diversity and access barriers, and it seems a shame that the majority of artworks only ever see the light of day if and when a curator deems them relevant enough. Using online technology, all collections could eventually be available to view regardless of current exhibition theme!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If and when that does happen, I will be interested to see how the role of &#8216;the curator&#8217; responds to that change.  The Pre-Raphaelite collection site already encourages users to create their own personal collections, so how far a leap would it be for people to share those collections and reasons for their choices with other users?  Imagine an itunes playlist or an amazon reading list &#8211; but for art, complete with personal interpretations, anecdotal thoughts, factual evidence and academic input.  THAT would be something I could become obsessive about!</p>

The next stops on the Home of Metal tour are Wolves Art Gallery (25 Oct), New Art Gallery Walsall (6 Nov with performance by Einstellung) and Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery (7 Feb)</li>
<li><a href="http://ihaveclones.com/2008/10/birmingham/">I Have Clones</a><br />
A musician who&#8217;s just moved back to Birmingham (to finish off a degree at Aston Uni).  He gets the whole blogging thing by the looks of things</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/culture/artist-curator-gavin-wade-np-exclusive-video-interview-0">Artist Curator Gavin Wade &#8211; NP Exclusive Video Interview</a><br />
&#8220;An exclusive video interview with artist curator Gavin Wade at the opening of the new gallery Eastside Projects in the heart of Digbeth the new cultural quarter of Birmingham UK&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kebablog.co.uk/?p=438">Kebablog &#8211; Balena Project_Birmingham. â€˜08 &#8211; Ikon Gallery</a><br />
Mr Kebablog went to see (and take pictures of) the Balena Project which features a 25ft cashmere whale in the Mailbox. It&#8217;s there until 26 Oct and if you&#8217;re reading this and can&#8217;t be bothered going to see it then perhaps I should point something out &#8211; IT&#8217;S A 25FT CASHMERE WHALE!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.taktak.net/Playground/Flimflam/Entry/271/TheFineArtofSayingHello.aspx">The Fine Art of Saying â€œHelloâ€ &#8211; TAK! Design &amp; Art Direction</a><br />
Pete linked to this over a year ago but I&#8217;ve just seen it again and think it deserves another outing.  It&#8217;s a presentation that Tak did to some illustrators on the art of self-promotion.  If anyone looks at this and thinks &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; then shout in the comments and set your face to &#8216;surprised&#8217; as help/further reading/etc come rolling in.Â  Seriously, give it a go</li>
