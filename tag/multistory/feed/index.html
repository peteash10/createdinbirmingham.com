The website for the big outdoor spectacular seems to be up now. Looks like a big, interesting thing and they&#8217;re after a load of volunteers too (click &#8216;get involved&#8217;)</li>

<blockquote><p>Arts Council England West Midlands&#8217; Digital Content Development (DCD) Programme is a three year programme of investment which aims to catalyse the creation and creative use of digital content platforms for arts organisations across the West Midlands region</p></blockquote>
<p>The website went up recently and the map on the homepage shows some of the projects, along with how much money they received. Further information is due on the website at some point, but if you look at the <a href="view-source:http://www.dcdprogramme.org.uk/">page source</a> then you can glean a little more.

<p><a href="http://www.multistory.org.uk/">Multistory</a> in association with <a href="http://www.thepublic.com/index.php/events/detail/black-country-stories-by-martin-parr/">The Public</a> present <a href="http://www.martinparr.com/index1.html">Martin Parr&#8217;</a>s unique look at life in the Black Country. After spending a year documenting modern day society and culture, The Public are preparing to unveil this collection of over 750 photographs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parr’s process of documenting and recording is fuelled by his passion  and a curiosity, taking inspiration from his surroundings.  His intimate  approach, photographing his subjects in their own environment, gives  him space to explore their lives and values in ways that often involve  inadvertent humour.</p></blockquote>
<p>Running alongside this will be an exhibition of photographs by students and staff of <a href="http://www.sandwell.ac.uk/">Sandwell College</a> Photography Department. ‘Show Me A Secret’ will explore and display their own interpretations of Black Country life following Martin Parr&#8217;s mentoring.</p>
<p>Both exhibitions run from Thursday 11 November 2010 to Sunday 23 January 2011; opening daily, 10am – 6pm, and have free entry.</p>

Worth bearing in mind &#8211; &#8220;I’ve worked out over a few years that “private view” means two things: if a show is big and important it means “no entry unless you’re invited”, if a show is small or not that well known it means “please come, there’ll be free wine and nibbles”. It’s developed as art-jargon for some reason, and people who know know and those that don’t don’t. But it does put off people who might otherwise have liked to have attended—and the smaller shows could do with that, in fact they want it.&#8221; Now to decide if your show is big and important or if it&#8217;s smaller</li>

<p>Still, I did make it along to the <a href="http://www.artsandbusiness.org.uk/News/2009/Jul_Sep/mid_jag_lr_awards.aspx">Arts &amp; Business Awards</a>. The special guest was Patrick Stewart (who walked, not teleported on stage &#8211; disappointing) and the winners were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Award &#8211; EC-Arts &amp; National Express Coach</li>
<li>Cultural Branding Award &#8211; Stan&#8217;s Cafe &amp; AE Harris (Birmingham) Ltd</li>

<p>Congrats to all of them.</p>
<p>After that I wandered down to the Sunflower Lounge for <a href="http://galleryofowls.org/news/all-you-can-eat-zine/">Gallery of Owl&#8217;s &#8216;All You Can Eat Zine&#8217;</a> which was fantastic &#8211; billed as &#8216;a night of Zines, comics, small press, music and performance&#8217;. It provided all of that as well as a palpable sense of</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stay for that long, but long enough to catch <a href="http://www.richardpeel.com/">Richard Peel</a>&#8216;s entertaining performance of Dracula, have a chat with Claire from <a href="http://www.attagrrl.co.uk/">ATTA grrl</a> a buy a couple of zines (ATTA grrl and Girls Who Draw, since you asked). There was a good turnout, a great atmosphere and the excitement of knowing there&#8217;s loads of interesting stuff going on around the city.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I picked up:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I meant to write this up a while back and was reminded by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/polarbearspoken">Polarbear</a> appearing on Radio 3&#8217;s The Verb (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fj2w6">click here to listen again</a>, he&#8217;s on at 11mins) the other night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gone on a bit about how good I think <a href="http://www.myspace.com/polarbearspoken">Polarbear</a> (Steve Camden to his mum) is and a few weeks back I went to see his show &#8216;If I Cover My Nose You Can&#8217;t See Me&#8217; at the REP (who joint-commissioned it with others).Â  In short (and I&#8217;d be prepared to go on at length if you really want) it was brilliant.</p>
<p>After the show everyone was ushered up to the REP&#8217;s mezzanine where musical partner Afrosaxon was manning the decks and graphic designer Goonism was sketching characters from the show. We also had a reading from one of Polarbear&#8217;s inspirations &#8211; a fantastic lady whose name, I&#8217;m ashamed to say, I didn&#8217;t get.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9.jpg" rel="lightbox[2205]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2206" title="polar-bear-6-of-9-by-lee-allen" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The photo below might need a bit of explaining.Â  Polarbear works with the West Brom-based <a href="http://www.multistory.org.uk/">Multistory</a> on arts projects with kids, doing all sorts including making these masks (his black eye is make-up from the show, by the way).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9.jpg" rel="lightbox[2205]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2207" title="polar-bear-by-lee-allen" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, it was great and if/when he comes back it&#8217;d be well worth checking his show out.Â  For that matter, I reckon spoken word in general is a hugely underrated artform.Â  I know there are a few things about but if you know of/organise anything of that ilk around Birmingham then feel free to hit the comments below with detais of your next event.</p>
