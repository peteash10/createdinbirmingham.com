				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Nearly five years ago, a group of friends and I decided to take some initiative and create for ourselves the kind of organisation and event that we would most want to be a part of.  The result is <a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/" target="_blank">Project X Presents</a> &#8211; a Birmingham based creative network producing events once or twice a year which aim to fuse many different strands of creative endeavour into one cohesive whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3587" title="project-x" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/project-x.jpg" alt="project-x" width="600" height="154" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/project-x.jpg 600w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/project-x-300x77.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what is a network anyway?  In our case, a free association of individuals bonded by two essential qualities &#8211; an interest in creativity and a friendly, open minded attitude.  We realised that between ourselves and our immediate friends we have between us a tremendous variety of interests and an urge to be together and be creative.  Weekly meetings began and continue still, the network steadily grew.   Our fifth event &#8211; Xhibition, comes up this Saturday in Moseley.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3586"></span>Something like Project X could happen and very probably is happening in many places around the world right now, as cultural change and the IT revolution put ever more power into the hands of us all.  The fact that it is happening here is surely a good sign &#8211; one flowering amongst many to rise out of a rich bed of active and creative individuals and groups.   The considerable diversity in both medium and content we&#8217;ve been able to manifest and the willingness to explore the boundaries of production and presentation suggest a very healthy grass roots level of creative practice and a varied and eclectic community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The independent scene in Birmingham can seem very strong &#8211; colossal events like <a href="http://www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk/" target="_blank">Drop Beats Not Bombs</a> show how much energy and drive there is in the in the city, although Boogie Dave has been sounding frustrated in his communications lately and has mentioned last weeks&#8217; event could be the last.  <a href="http://www.gigbeth.com/" target="_blank">Gigbeth</a> is seen by many as an establishment based event, but closer to the real truth is that it relies on the dynamism and organisational skills of one person, Clare Edwards.  Worrying then, that Clare isn&#8217;t planning another festival this year?  At least <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/" target="_blank">Supersonic</a> is going strong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wonder if there&#8217;s a bit of vacuum in the creative hierarchy of the city &#8211; which means when an organisation gets so far, its not immediately obvious where the support is at city level or the inroads to a national direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is the traditional Arts Council funded route to consider &#8211; eg the successes of <a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/" target="_blank">Friction Arts</a> and <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stans Cafe</a> although that route isn&#8217;t going to be for everyone and creativity isn&#8217;t something that travels well on predetermined paths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the community and the Council really care about creativity, expression and community cohesion then how can it be that one of our best and most energetic venues &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=11&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myspace.com%2Frainbowevents&amp;ei=oAQCSrSsL5TUjAeUjOGHBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGV2E-f1uBZWcLkJHHCTJyf3EkDog&amp;sig2=zaZmb4x_2qbj_F0AyT903w" target="_blank">the Rainbow</a> &#8211; is currently facing closure due to issues of noise abatement from the complaints of one person?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The City does try, but I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of <a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/" target="_blank">ArtsFest</a> &#8211; feeling it suffers from a lack of cohesion and direction that curation could bring.  It has its place perhaps, but its not enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps our lack of cohesion is an inevitable product of the very diversity we celebrate.   Perhaps the apparent lack of a clear, strong leadership at the city level in creative terms is in itself partly responsible for the relative strength of our independent scene?   Perhaps I just need to go lay down for a bit!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever is happening, or will happen, I&#8217;ve loved my time with Project X so far &#8211; its brought me into contact with a great many wonderful and talented people and for every difficult moment where it feels like an arduous labour of love, there are many more magic ones in which I sense &#8211; no, experience &#8211; our tremendous energy and appetite for progression, development, expression and fun.</p>

&#8220;Compete against other unsigned bands for the chance to support &#8216;Cage The Elephant&#8217; at the gig of a lifetime&#8221;.  That&#8217;s right, you can stop dreaming of Wembley and start thinking bigger &#8211; the mighty Bullring awaits</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stereographic.co.uk/blog/?p=29">Stereographic &#8211; The New Art Gallery Walsall</a><br />
Stereographic have been working on a &#8220;brand and communications refresh&#8221; for the New Art Gallery Walsall and here&#8217;s some of what they&#8217;ve been producing</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/news/?id=468">Birmingham Bach Choir &#8211; Now Recruiting &#8211; Audiences Central</a><br />
&#8220;Regular performances in Symphony Hall are accompanied by international orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, often with world-class soloists&#8230; You donâ€™t have to be an expert or a great singer to join the Birmingham Bach Choir but you should be able to read music and to enjoy working hard with everyone else to achieve the high standards we look to maintain&#8221;</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ll have to excuse some slightly hectic posting this week and next while I get my head round 300ish new RSS feeds and an inbox stuffed with interesting (and hopefully not yet out of date) emails.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also introduce myself properly later but for now, here&#8217;s a round-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">aCtiVe arts</a> is a steering group, made up of committed residents and local professionals, dedicated to providing quality arts experiences and opportunities for the Castle Vale community of North-East Birmingham&#8221;.  They have <a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">a blog</a> and you are advised to see what they&#8217;re doing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next <a href="http://www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk/">Drop Beats Not Bombs</a> runs from Friday 2 to Monday 5 May (the bank holiday) and tickets are available.  That&#8217;s at The Rainbow (and the warehouse and arches) in Digbeth.  There should be more info on their website but it was having bandwidth issues last I checked.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The people at the <a href="http://www.thepeopleshop.co.uk/">People</a> shop in Kings Heath are having a party with drinks and canapÃ©s at their store on Saturday 26th April from 10am until 5:30pm.  It&#8217;s in aid of Macmillan, there&#8217;s a raffle for a luxury goodie bag and visitors can have their photo taken by <a href="http://www.emilyquinton.com/">Emily Quinton</a>. Get all the info <a href="http://thepeopleshop.co.uk/index.php?main_page=fundraising">here</a>.Â  **UPDATE** It was a big success with Â£430 raised on the day.Â  More events will follow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simon has started a blog called <a href="http://birminghamcentral.blogspot.com/">Birmingham Central</a>.  He says he&#8217;s &#8220;been inspired by the recent blogging epidemic sweeping Birmingham and the value of a good blog to share news and information&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of bloggers, the next Birmingham Bloggers meet-up will be on Tuesday 29 April at Rooty Frooty in the Custard Factory.  <a href="http://www.podnosh.com/blog/2008/04/22/birminghambloggersmeet4/">Nick Booth</a> has more info but I refer you also to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=12243583846">Facebook event</a> and the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/495801/">Upcoming</a> page.</li>
