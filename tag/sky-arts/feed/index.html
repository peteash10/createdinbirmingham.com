<p>Digbeth based <a href="http://www.yamination.com/">Yamination Studios</a> have launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">kickstarter</a> to help them reach completion of their new animation &#8216;At-issue&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yamination is the hub of multi-award winning stop-motion/frame animator, Drew Roper.<i> ‘At-issue’</i> is his brand new short film about Bartholomew, an unemployed lovable puppet, and his audition for the dream job – acting. But when a bizarre affliction strikes, he grasps that unless he can learn to be himself, his dream won’t be realised.</p>
<p>Falling short of your own expectations and never giving up on your dreams is something everyone can relate to; this film gives a light hearted spin on that and some of the cultural issues facing Britain today. Bartholomew’s situation is one that many people face, so we are demonstrating that there is hope if you keep the faith, the persistence and the determination.</p>
<p><b>We are currently mid-way through production, but you can help us reach the finish line by pledging absolutely anything you can to help us finish the film. Please share the page and spread the word!</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Yamination Studios (<em>which is a mixture of yam-yam and animation nonetheless</em>) have a comprehensive list of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">kickstarter backer rewards</a> in return for helping to push them towards the finish line of their mission.</p>
<p>You can opt for various downloads, a signed DVD of the final film, A3/A1 prints, and even character drawings through to studio experiences; including animation workshops/masterclasses with skilled professionals (<em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em> and <em>Frankenweenie</em> Art Department Model Maker <strong>Yossel Simpson Little </strong>and<strong> </strong><em>Shaun the Sheep</em>, <em>Creature Comforts</em>, <em>Rastamouse</em> and Tim Burton&#8217;s <em>A Corpse Bride</em> character animator <strong>Tim Allen</strong>)<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">amongst other fantastic rewards</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about their intentions with the money (&#8220;not to be spent on beer&#8221;) and the full rewards list <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yaminationstudios/at-issue-a-short-film-from-drew-roper">on the kickstarter page too</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck Drew &amp; team!</p>

&#8220;Two days in a row this week I was asked for recommendations for food things happening in Birmingham […] Here&#8217;s my response&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/dailybulletin/news2/2011/07/27/details-of-new-birmingham-food-festival-unveiled-65233-29129085/">Details of new Birmingham food festival unveiled</a><br />
On the subject of food &#8211; &#8220;The 10-day celebration of food will take place from October 14-23 and replaces the former Taste of Birmingham festival, which was held in the summer&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://digbeth.org/2011/07/muthers-studio-new-venue-on-rea-street/">Muthers Studio – New Venue on Rea Street | Digbeth is Good</a><br />
&#8220;The opening of the Conservatory @ Muthers was celebrated last Friday with an inaugural gig headlined by Evil Alien, who did a stonking set to a pretty much full house&#8221;. Recording studio and now music venue</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2011/07/im-a-celebrity-get-me-to-a-birmingham-city-council-event.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+birminghamiNS+%28Birmingham%3A+It%27s+Not+Shit%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher">I’m a Celebrity Get me to a Birmingham City Council Event</a><br />
An FOI request shows how much the council has spent on celebrity speakers since 2005. I&#8217;m pleased to say that the only one of these that I saw was also the most expensive. Getting value for my council tax, there.</li>

John Oliver, that fella from The Daily Show, is from Birmingham. A star on Broad St surely beckons.</li>

&#8220;On Thursday I excitedly popped down to the new Zellig building (nr Custard Factory) for the launch of Inkygoodness Character Totem home-coming&#8221;</li>

&#8220;The challenge for arts organisations outside London is to embrace the blogosphere, and fast. I think we need to work hard to nurture the brave souls who are often spending their free time running what&#8217;s-on sites and blogs – invite them to our shows, treat them like proper journalists, buy them lunch, encourage our suppliers to buy advertising space on their websites, link to their sites from ours and so on. If we help listings sites and blogs to grow, we&#8217;re safeguarding the future of arts criticism.&#8221;</li>
