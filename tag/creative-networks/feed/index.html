				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d post my response to an email I received from someone the other day. The emailer said (and these are a couple of extracts):</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently looking for creative projects to get involved with in the Birmingham area, specifically film or media based projects. I have lots of transferable skills through studying film on my course and I am looking for possible work experience (unpaid) in TV, film or any kind of production, as a runner, film grip and/or any position where the skills I have may come in useful.</p>
<p>My biggest focus is finding opportunities, getting out there and getting involved in anything I can, from possible collaborations to arts events, workshops, anything to keep me busy and anything that allows me to be creative and continues the type of work I was doing on my course.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of anything specific but gave a few starting places. I operate on the assumption that CiB readers know much more than I do, so if anyone can add anything then please do in the comments. My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any specific opportunities at the moment. It&#8217;s a bit of a funny time for that kind of thing at the moment, what with Screen WM (who used to put on events and so on) closing down a few months back and Creative England (the body taking their place) only just getting up and running. In the meantime it might be worth looking at <a href="http://www.bsin.co.uk/">http://www.bsin.co.uk/</a> and seeing what they&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p>Also, have a look at these events, get yourself along and see who you meet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.producersforum.org.uk/">http://www.producersforum.org.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/">http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamsmc.com/">http://www.birminghamsmc.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.helloculture.net/">http://www.helloculture.net/</a> (this is on tomorrow)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Maybe see what courses are happening at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/ ">http://www.macarts.co.uk/</a> or <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/">http://light-house.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Thursday their are two very different creative meet-ups happening in the city:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3126" title="creative-networks" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creative-networls.jpg" alt="creative-networks" width="455" height="174" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creative-networls.jpg 949w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creative-networls-300x114.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Feb <a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com" target="_blank">Creative Networks</a> is the 3rd Creative Forum event with special guest speaker Ash Atalla, the writer and producer best known for producing The Office. The Creative Forum bit is usually a series of stands from organisations like Business Link and Screen WM on hand to offer advice. 5.30pm &#8211; 10.00pm</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3130" title="ning banner" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ningbanner_many-copy.jpg" alt="ning banner" width="522" height="99" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ningbanner_many-copy.jpg 522w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ningbanner_many-copy-300x56.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first <a href="http://bargbarg.ning.com/events/barg-2" target="_blank">BARG</a> happened last month; games were played, cake was eaten and their was a whole lot of enthusing and exploring of social mechanisms. The Second BARG will feature: a look at rapid prototyping kits for game, discussion of a planned St Patrick&#8217;s day game, evolution of the <a href="http://www.emergentgame.org.uk" target="_blank">Emergent Game</a> and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you didn&#8217;t attend last month, you can still get in on the fun by turning up at <span id="eventLocation">The Lamp Tavern, Digbeth at 7pm.</span></p>

This month&#8217;s guest speaker is Jan Faull, Archive Producer at the British Film Institute (BFI) who will introduce and explore highlights from key documentary projects made possible through the <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/nftva/">BFI National Archive.</a> It is free to attend.<a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/nftva/"><br />

<p>For those who have never been to Creative Networks I can wholly recommend it. They always choose really inspirational speakers like  <a href="http://http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112374/" target="_blank">Nick Broomfield</a> (<em>Biggie and Tupac, Kurt &amp; Courtney</em>) and of course <a href="http://peteashton.com/" target="_blank">Pete Ashton</a> and <a href="http://steflewandowski.com/">Stef Lewandowski</a> (founders of this here blog).</p>
<p>At each event their is an opportunity to pitch your business, project idea or to just introduce yourself to the audience. Your details then go on to a rather handsome newsletter and the website.  If you would like to pitch at the next CN event please contact Dave Taylor on 07989 498 550 or email <a href="mailto:creative.networks@tic.ac.uk">creative.networks@tic.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>From 4-6pm there&#8217;s the <a href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/">Birmingham Music Network</a> with a networking event for the city&#8217;s music-related peoples:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Birmingham branch of Musicians Union will be supplying luxury chocolate biscuits and good coffee for all. Thereâ€™s food and drink afterwards supplied by the creative networks lot too. Come and talk about music and what youâ€™re up to and meet some new people</p></blockquote>
<p>Then after that, and until 10pm, there&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com">Creative Networks</a> networking event.Â  They don&#8217;t mention biscuits or coffee but do speak of &#8220;From Bedroom To Broadcast: How to break into TV and the battle to retain your filmmaking integrity thereafter&#8221; which is a talk by <a href="http://www.twinklebum.co.uk/">Lee Kern</a>.Â  Lee recently set up a fake TV production company called Monkey Tennis to pitch ridiculous ideas to commissioners so he sounds ok to me.</p>
<p>Both events are free.Â  Here&#8217;s the flyer for the latter:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/05/28/fierces-platinum-programme-at-the-edge/">Fierce&#8217;s Platinum Programme</a> is at The Edge, some of it you can drop into, some you have to book.</li>
<li>Behind Closed Doors are holding the launch of <a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/2008/05/08/a-secret-garden/">The Secret Garden</a> &#8211; an installation round the back of the Custard Factory from 6pm to 8pm.</li>
<li>Fierce, again, are having a preview screening of <a href="http://www.myfiercefestival.co.uk/index.php?controller=event&amp;mm_action=view&amp;id=145">Helen</a>, a film entered for the Edinburgh and Sydney film festivals.  That&#8217;s at 6pm (for drinks with the film at 6.30pm) at the AMC Broadway Plaza cinema. You&#8217;ll have to book yourself in on 0121 244 8080 though, no turning up unannounced.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/portal/index.asp">Creative Networks</a> are holding their regular event at Millennium Point with a talk on how to Power Your Business With Web 2.0 from the CiB-affiliated Pete Ashton and Stef Lewandowski.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;ll be more too, but those are just the ones I&#8217;d have hoped to make it down to.  It&#8217;s a shame to miss out on things but on the other hand is great to see so much going on around town.</p>
