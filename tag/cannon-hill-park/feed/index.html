				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/images/BOCO/MISC/BirminghamOpera026cropsmall.jpg" width="541" height="241" /></p>
<blockquote><p>“Born of a passion and a belief that opera can speak directly to all kinds of people, Artistic Director, Graham Vick, set out to create a company that the people of Birmingham &#8211; a city of many peoples &#8211; could be proud of…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">…We&#8217;ve got more exploring to do to discover where opera can be performed. How to perform it. How to re-write the rules of engagement between audiences and performer. How to experiment with space and acoustics. Who can we make it speak to?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/about-us" target="_blank">Birmingham Opera Company</a> would like to invite you to their production of <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/our-projects" target="_blank">Khovanskygate: A National Enquiry</a>.  You may have already heard a sneak preview at Springhill Tesco Superstore, where professional soloists Joseph Guyton and Stephanie Corley were accompanied by Sergey Rybin on piano. The singers performed a selection of opera favourites from Tosca, Madame Butterfly and Othello, demonstrating their talents whilst preparing to play the roles of Prince Andrei and Emma in this latest production.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The opera will take place in a big top tent at Cannon Hill Park, with performances at 7pm on the 22nd, 24th, 28th and 30th April before a final performance on the 2nd May.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story depicts Russia in the midst of a division between powerful conservative forces and growing Westernising influence. Musorgsky paints a devastating portrait of a nation on the brink of collapse; torn apart by state corruption, religious fanaticism, social inequality and ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unique setting and involvement from local performers already sets the bar for an interesting series of evenings. Birmingham Opera Company released an open call for singers with varied to little experience in performance, asking them to join in with rehearsals several days a week. If you&#8217;d like to become involved with Birmingham Opera Company&#8217;s projects yourself, then please contact them at <a href="mailto:getinvolved@birminghamopera.org.uk">getinvolved@birminghamopera.org.uk</a> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We wish the cast and Birmingham Opera Company the best of luck for the shows. For telephone booking information please call 0121 246 6632 Monday &#8211; Friday 9:00am-11:00am or use the following <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/" target="_blank">link</a> for further information and online booking.<i></i></p>

<p>As part of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com">Supersonic</a> festival, <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Capsule</strong></a> have decided to get the kids involved in exploring experimental music. The <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/news/supersonic-kids-gigs/2010/">Kids Gigs</a> take place on Saturday 23 October at 11am and 2.30pm at <strong><a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/" target="_blank">mac</a></strong> in Cannon Hill Park.</p>
<p>Aimed at 2 – 7 year olds and their families, these 1 hour workshops will involve performances, offering &#8216;Big Sounds for Little People&#8217;. <strong><a href="http://www.mrunderwood.co.uk/glatze_supersonic09_diary_review.html" target="_blank"></a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Ever since Schoenberg and Kandinsky became pen pals back in 1907,   avant-garde art and experimental music has been attempting to find some   common ground.  But, it’s not been easy.  While modern art is a mass   phenomenon, experimental music is often derided and ignored by the   masses.</p></blockquote>
<p>With a view to introduce children to  experimental music at an early age, the events will feature one-man band from the USA, <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com/line-up/events/dosh">Dosh</a>, and local circuit-bending fiend <strong><a href="http://www.mrunderwood.co.uk/glatze_supersonic09_diary_review.html" target="_blank">Glatze.</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Glatze uses customised instruments (including: circuit-bent Furby  dolls  and kids’ toys) that have been specially rewired to create all  sorts of  musical wizardry. Dosh a multi-instrumentalist; combines a  host of  instruments into an exciting and unique live experience.  See  firsthand  how these unlikely instruments are used to make noise / sound  / music,  and to have a go yourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tickets are only £5, and can be booked at <strong><a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.macarts.co.uk</a></strong> or by calling <strong>0121 446 323</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 336px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Kate Chapman &amp; Charlotte Goodwin - Amplifying the Map" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3371/3605031080_4c92e701c6_o.gif" alt="" width="326" height="245" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kate Chapman &amp; Charlotte Goodwin - Amplifying the Map</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to admit to be SUPER excited about the impending re-opening of the mac.  So ANY news, or any work linked to the opening, in turn excites me too.  In addition, my personal interests are deeply rooted in events which involve an element of participation &#8211; and with that in mind, I&#8217;m <em>particularly </em>excited to touch upon &#8216;Site and Sounds&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Site and Sounds offers a taste of the activities planned for mac’s re-opening in 2010 including workshops, walks and the premiere of a specially composed anthem for mac. mac’s Associate Artists <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> and <a href="http://www.motionhouse.co.uk/" target="_blank">Motionhouse Dance Theatre</a> will also be presenting work as part of the summer programme including an adventure in the dark and some in-your-face dancing.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s a substantial programme of events leading up to the re-opening &#8211; details of which can be found on the <a href="http://macartists.co.uk/home.html" target="_blank">macartists</a> website, as well as information on how to book for workshop places.  I was excited to see a <a href="http://macartists.co.uk/events-menu/11-1st-august-2-5pm-time-and-place-screen-printing-workshop.html" target="_blank">screen-printing workshop</a> advertised, then realised I am sadly 16 years too old to take part. Sniffle.  If you DO fit into that age category however, I think it&#8217;ll be a lot of fun!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m also curious about the recent theme of &#8216;mapping&#8217; which keeps cropping up in projects and artist&#8217;s works of late.  This time, artists Kate Chapman and Charlotte Goodwin are exploring the mapping theme by inviting people who live, work or play close to mac to re-discover familiar places and explore places they have never visited before, sharing their thoughts and observations to create an audio map of the changing landscape.  All of these recordings will feed into an audio map – a web of downloadable audio tracks focusing on different locations in a mile radius of Cannon Hill Park.  I&#8217;m wondering if any CiB readers have experienced any other map-themed artworks/projects of late &#8211; if so, send me an email or leave a comment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will also be interested to see &#8216;Underground&#8217;,  performed by four dancers from <a href="http://www.motionhouse.co.uk/" target="_blank">Motionhouse Dance Theatre</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Set within a rocking tubular structure, using physical dance, poignant imagery and surprising aerial encounters, &#8216;Underground&#8217;, explores the reality of train travel.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the title of the performance, I imagine it would originally by inspired by the experience of underground travel as opposed to regular trains.  How this will translate both to regular train travel as well as the open space of Cannon Hill Park will remain a mystery until the performance itself, which is happening Saturday 18th July at Cannon Hill Park at 11.30am, 1pm and 3pm.</p>
