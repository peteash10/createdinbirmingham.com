				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just read an email pointing out that Creative Playground has changed tack slightly and is now <a href="http://www.meetup.com/digitalplayground/">Digital Playground</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital Playground was created in an  attempt to network the digital creative industries within Birmingham</p></blockquote>
<p>The next meet-up is on Friday 25 June at the Spotted Dog in Digbeth. Joining <a href="http://www.meetup.com/digitalplayground/">the Meetup group</a> and RSVP-ing would be handy.</p>
<p>There should be a fair few people down there. As well as this, the Spotted Dog will be hosting <a href="http://digbeth.org/2010/06/dogbeth-is-goods-second-birthday-this-friday-25th-june/">Digbeth is Good&#8217;s 2nd birthday</a> and the folks at <a href="http://www.aquila-tv.com/">Aquila TV</a> are relocating their regular All Bar One drinks for the evening.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be popular for another reason. A meet-up for Digital Playground? Um, did anyone try googling that?</p>
