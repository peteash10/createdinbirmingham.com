				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NB &#8211; There&#8217;s no conclusions drawn at the end of this post &#8211; I&#8217;m just linking a bunch of vaguely related stuff together.</p>
<p>Daden, the serious games people, have put <a href="http://www.daden.co.uk/studentprojects.html">a list of potential student projects online</a>. Daden&#8217;s <a href="http://www.daden.co.uk/press_releases/student_project_list_launched.html">David Burden explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In meetings with Universities the topic would often turn to ideas for student projects. We&#8217;d always have our ideas when the students were already committed, and the Universities would always be searching for ideas just when we couldn&#8217;t think of any</p></blockquote>
<p>Which made me think of <a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=12014">this from D&#8217;Log</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just an idea. How about a website called WorkGang, which links together unemployed graduates and the growing number of public-sector unemployed, who want to find people near them with the same interests and skills — with a view to forming an autonomous self-managed group to do a short-term “socially useful project”, on their own terms and in their own time?</p></blockquote>
<p>It also put me in mind of things like <a href="http://hackitude.org/">Hackitude</a> and <a href="http://www.launch48.com/launch48-birmingham-announced/">Launch48</a>, where people with various sets of skills get together to do stuff together in quite a short period of time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=ideas+bank">If you Google &#8216;ideas bank&#8217;</a> you&#8217;ll come up with any number of databases of half-baked ideas &#8211; that&#8217;s fairly well-trodden ground. Is there room for something a bit more nuanced/locally focussed?</p>
