				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the kratesitwards (as some are calling them) on Saturday, <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/peteashton/videos/10/">Coun Neville Summerfield bigged up</a> some of the support initiatives for creative types in Birmingham:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative Birmingham &#8211; pulling together key public agencies investing in the creative industries</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=72565&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=5001">Design Space</a> &#8211; accommodates and finances new design agencies in the Jewellery Quarter</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=24892&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=12327">SRB6 Creative Industries</a> &#8211; offers a range of business support to new businesses in the north-west of the city</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=80916&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=121">Enterprise City</a> &#8211; provides coaching and mentoring services to new and expanding businesses</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=35556&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=13361&amp;EXPAND=5001">Business Support for Creative Industries Programme</a> &#8211; Â£9m flagship initiative.Â  Created 800 jobs, safeguarded 400 jobs, helped start 250 businesses and supported 1,200 businesses in total.Â  Generated over Â£15m in new sales</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I can tell, SRB6 has ended, enrolment in Enterprise City is closed (the scheme ends in March 09) and I can&#8217;t find any info about Creative Birmingham at all.</p>
<p>D&#8217;log tried looking into the schemes mentioned when Coun Summerfield responded to the issue of support for the creative sector last month. <a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=5264">He had problems finding any useful information too</a>.</p>
<p>The thing is, maybe there are lots of helpful support schemes out there but how many eligible people/companies know about them and where&#8217;s the information being made available? I guess the place to go would be <a href="http://www.creativelaunchpad.co.uk/">Creative Launchpad</a> (currently <a href="http://creativelaunchpad.wordpress.com/">residing online here</a>) or <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/">Business Link</a> but it&#8217;s a shame the info doesn&#8217;t seem to be collected together somewhere useful.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;ve just found <a href="http://www.westmidlandsfinance.com">West Midlands Finance</a>, which describes itself as &#8220;comprehensive, continually updated finance information for West Midlands SMEs&#8221;. Feel free to register and have a root about but the need to register has put me right off &#8211; what&#8217;s the need exactly? Humph.</p>

Email your Tour Dates, Record release information, flyers, posters, and the rest to info(at)birminghammusicnetwork.com (take particular note of HOW they want your info &#8211; help them to help you)</li>

They&#8217;ve redesigned their website and it looks lovely</li>

Pretty fascinating stuff</li>

Pete Green says &#8220;I used to be in a band called The Regulars. We made an album called Effortless. You can&#8217;t buy it any more because there were only 100 copies. But you can download it from this blog, one track at a time, and read the lyrics and notes and stuff&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/news/detail/193/creative_media_networking_event__thursday_13th_november/">Creative media networking event &#8211; Thurs 13th November</a><br />
It&#8217;s at Kings Heath Cricket club from 10am to 12.30pm. I think it&#8217;s being organised by Creative Launchpad but can&#8217;t find any info on their own website (or anywhere else) about it</li>

Any musicians out there want to help with a 3-day project at the Shard End youth centre? It&#8217;s with Headliners who do journalism projects for young uns and they&#8217;re offering some free publicity</li>
<li><a href="http://fusedmagazine.wordpress.com/2008/10/27/buy-art-from-the-underground/">Buy Art from the Underground &#8211; Fused Magazine</a><br />
Nice to have Fused back and blogging.  They&#8217;ve spotted that Simon &amp; Tom Bloor and Juneau Projects were commissioned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the roundel</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spaghettigazetti.com/2008/10/artist-studios-to-rent.html">Second City Gallery looking for resident artists</a><br />
Mark Wilkinson and Sophie Handy weren&#8217;t impressed with a lack of collectively rentable, large studio/exhibition spaces so they&#8217;ve found their own.  Give them a call if you&#8217;re interested in getting involved</li>
<li><a href="http://creativelaunchpad.wordpress.com/free-training/">FREE training &#8211; Creative Launchpad</a><br />
Want to attend a course called &#8220;Business Planning for a Successful Creative Business&#8221;? You&#8217;re in luck&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/jobs/listing/?id=680">Job listing for Web Editor Internship, Flatpack Festival</a><br />
The Flatpack folk are looking for, essentially, a blogger with benefits. It&#8217;s unpaid but doing this sort of thing for Fierce is what started me on my journey to where I am now, and I&#8217;ve done ok</li>
<li><a href="http://plusdesignexpo.blogspot.com/2008/10/plus-touring-city-with-walking-tours.html">Plus+ Touring the city with the Walking Tours</a><br />
I seem to remember the walking tours of Birmingham, with historian Ben Waddington as the guide, went down very well last year. Here are the plans for this year</li>

Based in Cov, filmed in location in Birmingham and co-financed by Screen WM.  Hurrah all round!</li>
