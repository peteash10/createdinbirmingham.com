<p>Since we <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/01/13/project-pigeon/">first introduced</a> <a href="http://www.project-pigeon.co.uk/">Project Pigeon</a>, they&#8217;ve been busy working on their community pigeon loft, which looks to have had some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/communitypigeonloft/">interesting design suggestions</a>. Tomorrow marks the first of their workshops providing a step by step guide to keeping pigeons.</p>
<p>The workshops will take place from 2-4pm on the dates below, at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=digbeth&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Digbeth,+Birmingham&amp;gl=uk&amp;ei=tndeTYKjOMqp8AOakMVZ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCAQ8gEwAA">Project Pigeon’s Loft, Milk Street</a>, Digbeth, Birmingham (in Boxxed’s backyard opposite Birmingham Backpackers under a viaduct). It&#8217;s free to go along, but places should be booked in advance via email at: <a title="mailto:projectpigeondigbeth@gmail.com" href="mailto:projectpigeondigbeth@gmail.com">projectpigeondigbeth@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve got lined up through until April;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Saturday 19th February:  Introduction to pigeon fancying</strong></p>
<p>Find out about the history of pigeon fancying, meet some pigeon fanciers and find out about why they keep pigeons, meet Project Pigeon’s birds and watch some pigeons fly.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 25th February:  A pigeon’s home and life </strong></p>
<p>This workshop will be focused on the different seasons in a pigeons life, from racing season to breeding season.  We will also look at the different kinds of pigeon lofts there are.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 26th February:  Day to day pigeon loft management</strong></p>
<p>How to keep your pigeons clean and happy &#8211; from cleaning the loft to giving the pigeons a bath.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 4th March:  Making nest boxes and perches</strong></p>
<p>A woodwork session where we will design and make essential items for the inside of pigeon lofts and make any loft repairs</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 5th March:  Racing pigeons, Birmingham rollers and tipplers</strong></p>
<p>There are many kinds of pigeons, racing pigeons are used in racing, Birmingham rollers in sequence flying and tipplers in endurance flying.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 11th March:  A pigeon’s diet</strong></p>
<p>Like any athlete a pigeons diet is very important.  In this session you will find out about all the vital vitamins, minerals and foods needed to keep pigeons on top form.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 12th March:  Veterinary skills</strong></p>
<p>Vets in the UK know little about racing pigeons, and if you took your pigeon to the vet every time there was something wrong it would cost a lot and wouldn’t be practical.  Learn about what kinds of injuries pigeon get and how you can help your pigeon.</p>
<p><strong>Friday 18th March:  Breeding</strong></p>
<p>Come and see and learn about squeekers (baby pigeons)!</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 19th March:  Training and racing</strong></p>
<p>How do pigeons find their way home?  How do you train a racing pigeon?  How do you win a race?!</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 2nd April:  Making a magazine about pigeons</strong></p>
<p>Help Project Pigeon design a magazine based on what we have learnt during the workshops.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday 16th April:  Come and watch a live pigeon race!</strong></p>
<p>You might have been to the horses or to the dogs but have you ever seen a pigeon race?  Now is your chance!  Please email if you intend to come to this because the time of the race will only be known on Saturday morning &#8211; the morning of the race.</p></blockquote>
