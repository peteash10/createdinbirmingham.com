				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m actually slightly embarrassed to be giving this one any more oxygen &#8211; it&#8217;s a non-story on a slow news day and should really be treated as such. For some reason, though, I&#8217;ve found myself getting sucked in. So&#8230;</p>
<p>To give a bit of background, every so often the city council (or a Birmingham-focussed organisation) will award a contract to a company unfortunate enough to be based somewhere other than Birmingham. In the past couple of years <a href="http://www.marketingbirmingham.com/">Marketing Birmingham</a> and <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">the MAC</a> have been lambasted for looking further afield for suppliers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/lob">Library of Birmingham</a> is the latest, having awarded a PR contract to a company in London called <a href="http://www.colmangetty.co.uk/">Colman Getty</a> after a tendering process which involved several local companies. Unfortunately, the result has been the kind of short-sighted outcry that clamours for protectionism and only makes us look ridiculous, parochial and insecure.</p>
<p>The Birmingham Post have provided the headline most likely to feature in indignant tweets:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/04/05/library-of-birmingham-marketing-contract-awarded-to-london-firm-65233-28466192/">Library of Birmingham marketing contract awarded to London firm</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas Business Desk WM have been a bit more measured with:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/news/151352-midlands-firms-beaten-to-library-pr-contract-by-london-agency.html?news_section=54022">Midlands firms beaten to Library PR contract by London agency</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I like how those two seem to imply slightly different things.</p>
<p><strong>On the plus side</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so they might not be from around these parts, and I can&#8217;t tell whether the best company won (I haven&#8217;t read the proposals and I didn&#8217;t see the pitches) but lets see if they have <em>anything</em> to recommend them.</p>
<p>Colman Getty&#8217;s clients includes cultural and literary institutions like the Saatchi Gallery, Manchester&#8217;s Lowry Centre, the Man Booker Prize, Cheltenham Literary Festival and JK Rowling. So that experience could come in handy when drawing up a &#8220;high impact regional, national and international campaign&#8221; for the LoB.</p>
<p>Although bids of up to £350,000 were invited, they&#8217;ve asked for £292,000 (83% of the total). That seems decent of them, especially as we all know how expensive those London agencies are.</p>
<p>Incidentally, someone mentioned that that&#8217;s a lot of money to spend on marketing. Bearing in mind that&#8217;s to cover activity over a three-year period for a £189m project that&#8217;s meant to give Birmingham some international profile it doesn&#8217;t seem all that much to me.</p>
<p><strong>The interesting bit that&#8217;s been missed</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Colman Getty&#8217;s MD says she&#8217;s looking forward to working with Birmingham City Council and, more interestingly, &#8220;our partners, <a href="http://www.writingwestmidlands.org/">Writing West Midlands</a>&#8220;. So there&#8217;s a local link. It&#8217;ll be good to find out what role they&#8217;ll be playing.</p>
<p><strong>If you only read one thing&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>What I usually do when this issue crops up is point towards <a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/09/local-work-for-local-people.html">the guest post that Fullrange&#8217;s Lee Kemp wrote for the Birmingham Post</a> a couple of years ago. It&#8217;s the best explanation I&#8217;ve come across for why reserving regional projects for regional companies is a bad idea. Although I should give a nod to <a href="http://iam.peteashton.com/local-pride-doesnt-mean-quality/">Pete Ashton&#8217;s post</a> and the comments below it.</p>
<p>So, while I&#8217;m sorry for the likes of <a href="http://www.rewiredpr.com/">Rewired</a> and <a href="http://www.sx-media.com/">S&amp;X</a> (who are understood to have pitched for the work &#8211; and I&#8217;ve only got the BPo and BLWM stories to go from) and others who pitched, it&#8217;s surely healthy to bring others into the city.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>I might round-up a load of work that companies in Birmingham have been winning from under the noses of other agencies in other cities. No-one seems to make so much of a fuss over that news.</p>
