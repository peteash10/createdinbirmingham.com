				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This happened the other day but I only just came across (listings sites are available for Birmingham &#8211; CiB isn&#8217;t one of them). I&#8217;m posting it anyway, partly because it looks like it was an interesting thing and partly because it&#8217;s so frustrating trying to find out what&#8217;s coming out of <a href="http://thisisfeed.co.uk/">FEED</a> that I&#8217;ll take what I can get, when I can get it. Not that I&#8217;ve any idea what their involvement was.</p>
<p>There were lots of people involved in this one though &#8211; it was produced by <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/wasted/">Birmingham Rep</a> (with a couple of others) in association with FEED and Birmingham Met College (among others) and performed at the mac.</p>

<p>More Canals Than Venice has the <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/degree-shows-2010/">list  of BIAD shows</a>.</p>

There&#8217;s a show called We Are The New DNA at the <a href="http://www.thisisfeed.co.uk/">FEED</a> and fashion labs at Millennium Point too,  but I can&#8217;t find any info online (see photo of poster below instead).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.7512.co.uk/"><img class="size-full wp-image-5993 aligncenter" title="Screen shot 2010-06-04 at 16.03.50" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2010-06-04-at-16.03.50.png" alt="" width="472" height="314" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2010-06-04-at-16.03.50.png 472w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-shot-2010-06-04-at-16.03.50-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /></a></p>
<p>Their <a href="http://www.theimagefile.com/web/suttoncoldfieldcollege/exhibition.html">end of year show</a> will be for one night at Masonic Buildings on  Severn  Street, Birmingham on 25th June from 6.30pm till 9.00pm and the after show  party will  be at the same venue from 9.00pm till late, by invitation  only.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some background to the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>The students, this year, have chosen to voice their displeasure and  resentment at the draconian and ill-conceived Section 44 of the  Terrorism Act. Many of the students have been accosted and questioned by  the police and security guards whilst in the act of taking photographs  for assignments in the course. Also, many of the public have confronted  the students during their photographic activities accusing them of  potential child offences even though they were clearly photographing a  tree or derelict buildings etc.</p></blockquote>
