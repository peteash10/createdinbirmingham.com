<p style="text-align: justify;">With all the build-up and enthusiasm for dance performances during <a title="Get Your Dancing Shoes – IDFB 2014" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2014/04/26/idfb-2014/" target="_blank">IDFB</a> I feel well and truly ready for BE Festival 2014. Having not personally attended <a title="The first BE Festival" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/08/the-first-be-festival/" target="_blank">BE Festival</a> before I was a little unsure of what to expect, and so took the opportunity to visit the 2014 launch at Birmingham Rep on the 16<sup>th</sup> April. I was quickly immersed into a world of acting, exciting workshops and performers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BE Festival has been hosted in Birmingham since 2010 after responding to an Arts Council-hosted conference entitled, ‘The Challenge of Change: How can we make a better future for theatre, here in the West Midlands?’ in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5 years on, the realised dream of BE Festival still continues. Having invited performers from 11 different countries to take part in this years’ amazing selection of 22 performances, the festival has already attracted a large following.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/93095334"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/teatro-sotterraneo.jpg" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year The Rep will open their doors to BE Festival, with the main stage itself set to feature a pop-up restaurant. There they will be serving delicious interval dinners to artists and audiences so that they can have an opportunity to eat together each evening. The menus include vegetarian options and advance bookings for this are now available through box-office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://befestival.org/festival/dinner-2014/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/restaurant.jpg" width="448" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ll now be able to see all of the wonderful events planned which include visual arts and talks, workshops, performances and even musical post-show events, finishing with an Awards Party on the 12th of July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even better, if you’d like a chance to be involved with BE Festival, meeting the performers and organisers behind the action then you might be interested in their <a href="http://befestival.org/get-involved/volunteers/" target="_blank">volunteering opportunities</a>. Open until the 12<sup>th</sup> of May, volunteering opportunities with BE Festival also include 6 positions for aspiring stage managers/technicians to form part of the Production Team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to volunteer please send an email detailing your interest, any relevant skills, experience and CV to emmahalsteadbe@gmail.com. Volunteers will be needed in May and then throughout June and July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the full 2014 programme please see <a href="http://befestival.org/festival/programme-2014/">HERE</a>.</p>
