				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in July, <a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk/">Rosie Kay Dance Company</a> performed <a title="The Great Train Dance" href="http://dancingforthegames.co.uk/about/the-great-train-dance/">The Great Train Dance</a> on the Severn Valley Railway between Kidderminster and Highley:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Great Train Dance performers; dancers and students from throughout the region, transformed the Severn Valley Railway into a magical experience with a puzzle to solve. In a Hitchcock thriller designed for families, this fascinating performance drew all ages on the train into the world of the absurd and seduce everyone into hunting for clues.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UrVVkANY7Zg" frameborder="0" width="600" height="335"></iframe></p>
<p>I missed this &#8211; I got stuck in traffic on the way there and just missed the train &#8211; so it&#8217;s good to see a film&#8217;s been produced (by Louis Price). It can&#8217;t have been easy to shoot though, there&#8217;s all sorts going on and was only performed once. It looks like it was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>During my first stint on Created in Birmingham I had a nagging feeling that there was loads of good dance stuff going on but it was all happening under my radar. I&#8217;m pretty much on top of it these days, partly for the reasons given in the disclaimer at the bottom of this post but mainly because there&#8217;s so much dance stuff happening around the city this year.</p>
<p>Anyway, from tomorrow until Sunday, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk">British Dance Edition</a> &#8211; a biennial showcase of the British dance scene &#8211; is in Birmingham. It&#8217;s a big deal, with <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/venues/">loads of venues</a> hosting performances, events, presentations and debates. It&#8217;s a national showcase, not a local one, but there&#8217;s a fair bit of local interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rosie Kay previewing her new piece, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/the-body-is-the-frontline">5 SOLDIERS &#8211; The Body Is The Frontline</a></li>
<li>DanceXchange showing some of their work on <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/repeat-performance-the-5-man-show">The 5 Man Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/listen">Listen</a> by Ace Dance &amp; Music</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/funny-bones">Funny Bones</a>, from dX and Two&#8217;s Company Management</li>
<li>Receptions hosted by <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/international-dance-festival-birmingham-reception">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/reception-birmingham-royal-ballet-and-elmhurst-sch">Birmingham Royal Ballet</a> and <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/reception-people-dancing">People Dancing</a>.</li>
<li>Walking tours of the city for delegates (<a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/digbeth-walking-tour-with-ian-jelf">Digbeth</a> and the <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/birmingham-city-walking-tour-3-jewellery-quarter">Jewellery Quarter</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more too. Most of it&#8217;s for paying delegates only but there are <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/public-events/">some good public events too</a>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer &#8211; I&#8217;m working on/at British Dance Edition (incl <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/multi-platform-dance-the-future-of-dance-online">one of the debates</a>) and <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>. <a href="http://westmidlandsdance.com/">WestMidlandsDance.com</a> is one of my websites too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lichfieldfestival.org">Lichfield Festival</a> starts on 3 July and closes on the 13th with a programme of music, theatre, visual arts and film.</p>
<p>A nice touch (cos I look for this things) is a <a href="http://lichfieldfestivaldirector.blogspot.com/">blog by the Festival Director, Richard Hawley</a>, who has been posting his thoughts up all this week.</p>
<p>You can see the festival programme but it&#8217;s worth highlighting the local talent on show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dancer, director and chereographer, <a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk/">Rosie Kay</a>, will perform her current project, The Wild Party, for the last time at the Garrick Theatre on Sat 5 July.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/page/symphony-hall-birmingham/the-symphony-organ/thomas-trotter-city-organist/">Thomas Trotter</a>, Birmingham&#8217;s city organist, will play at Lichfield Cathedral on 7 and 9 July.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/polarbearspoken">PolarBear</a>, described as &#8216;<a href="http://www.channel4.com/4talent/ten4/polarbear.htm">one of Britain&#8217;s foremost performance poets</a>&#8216;, is doing a late night session at the Garrick Studio on 9 July.Â  I&#8217;m listening to the tracks on his MySpace as I type this and he&#8217;s really (really) good.</li>
</ul>

Pete mentioned this back in January and pointed out how truly international the line-up is, with performers from Taiwan, Australia, South Africa, Cuba and Russia, as well as &#8220;rising star&#8221; Rosie Kay from Birmingham.

<p>The <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a> started today and continues until Sunday 25 May at venues all over the city.   Pete <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/01/18/dance-festival-in-may/">mentioned this</a> back in January and pointed out how truly international the line-up is, with performers from Taiwan, Australia, South Africa, Cuba and Russia, as well as &#8220;rising star&#8221; <a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk/">Rosie Kay</a> from Birmingham.</p>
<p>The full line-up for this week (and indeed the other weeks) can be seen on their <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/events/list.php?eventType=P&amp;showRange=W1">events page</a>.</p>
<p>Pulling out highlights would be a fool&#8217;s errand but for those looking to sample the impressive wares without parting with their hard-earned, there are a few free events to catch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performances in shop windows around the city centre are taking place daily from midday all this week &#8211; head for Oasis, the Puma Store, Bathstore and Chamberlain Square.  More details <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/events/item.php?ID=148">here</a>.</li>
<li>In Victoria Square on Friday night, 9pm and on Saturday at 4pm and 9pm you can see <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/events/item.php?ID=88">Watch This Space</a> which I have very high hopes for indeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, the festival has <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/blog/">a blog</a>, although I see this hasn&#8217;t been updated in the past week.  I&#8217;m hoping they use it to collect together all the photos, videos and reviews that will be spun out by visitors to the events, similar to the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/category/collective-memories/">Collective Memories</a> that Pete did here (and that I&#8217;ll be continuing to do).</p>
