<p><strong>Behna (Sisters)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This unique and intimate theatre production by <a href="http://www.kalitheatre.co.uk/">Kali Theatre</a> will be performed in the kitchens of Punjabi households across the Black Country from 22 March to 15 April.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the day before a wedding, Ladies&#8217; Sangeet Night, in a Punjabi household. The bride is having her henna done and the guests are busy eating, singing and dancing. But in the kitchen, sibling jealousy simmers alongside the samosas.  Fast-paced, funny and moving, Behna takes a look through the keyhole of a family house to reveal the secrets and lies of two generations of sisters.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>One, Nineteen</strong></p>
<p>One, Nineteen from local ‘Archers’ writer, Tim Stimpson, is on at <a href="http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk/">The Old Joint Stock Theatre</a> on 18 &amp; 19 March.</p>
<blockquote><p>19th January: Freak storms bring devastating floods to the English coast, but before the rescue effort arrives, the media are already in town spinning their story. A play about the power of the news, the strength of the government, the question of climate change, and of course, and the search for Sam, Jack and little Chloe&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>After premiering in London, it was given a 4 star review from Time Out, so it&#8217;s probably worth a watch.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After settling at 183 Fazeley Street back in 2008, <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk">Ikon</a> have confirmed that as of April 2011, Ikon Eastside will be closing up for the final time, due to public funding cuts.</p>
<p>The large exhibition space at the heart of Digbeth, has provided the perfect setting for large-scale work, video and events over the past few years. It&#8217;s hosted work by internationally recognised artists, including Andy Warhol, Damián Ortega, Józef Robakowski and Siobhan Davies Dance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/480/rites_of_spring_ikon_music_fes/"><em>Rites of Spring</em></a>, a three day music festival featuring Turner  Prize winner <a href="http://www.martincreed.com/">Martin Creed</a>, <a href="http://www.modifiedtoyorchestra.com/">Modified Toy Orchestra</a> and <a href="http://www.epic45.com/wordpress/">Epic45</a> will be the  last event held at Ikon Eastside, from 7 &#8211; 9 April.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are extremely saddened to be losing Ikon Eastside, but our commitment to bringing internationally recognised art to the city is unwavering. Looking to the future, our goal remains to create a permanent museum of contemporary art for Birmingham.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Jonathan Watkins, Ikon Director</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all sad news though, since Ikon are intending to keep up their involvement with the Eastside district, focusing instead on site-specific events and promoting cultural regeneration through their membership of the Eastside Contemporary Art Consortium. Their current study into the feasibility of this permanent museum, (&#8216;Ikon Two&#8217;) also remains unaffected.</p>
