A list of West Mids orgs that haven&#8217;t grasped something as head-smackingly basic as making news available via RSS. For a sec I thought of doing a similar list for Birmingham&#8217;s creative types but actually I can&#8217;t think of enough &#8216;RSS Rotters&#8217; to name. Which is good (but if your news isn&#8217;t available via RSS yet then sort it before Joanna Geary comes after you! If you&#8217;re not sure then email createdinbrum@gmail.com and I&#8217;ll help)</li>

David is &#8220;a lancastrian with a ukulele (nothing new there you might think) but i also have been known to play with, a DD-5 drum machine, a casiotone MT-46, and a glockenspiel&#8221;. I don&#8217;t tend to mention musicians here much (too many to mention) but he gets in because he knits all his merchandise. For his sake I hope he doesn&#8217;t get too big. He&#8217;s playing Bohemian Jukebox on Tues 9 Dec at the Hare &amp; Hounds</li>
