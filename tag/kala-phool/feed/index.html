				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best events I went to last year was Kala Phool&#8217;s Mother India: 21st Century Remix &#8211; a live re-scoring of the Bollywood classic that blew me away. I&#8217;ve wittered on about it <a href="http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/2008/08/mother-india-21st-century-remix/">on my blog</a>.</p>
<p>I was really pleased to hear that the musicians will be in the studio (in Birmingham) next week to record the soundtrack and <a href="http://www.kalaphool.com/">Kala Phool</a> are trying to put together a national tour for later in the year.</p>
<p>Kala Phool are after a film maker to make a kind of video &#8216;calling card&#8217; for this. However, the bad news is there&#8217;s no budget available for the work. I must say I don&#8217;t tend to like posting these sorts of requests but I&#8217;m making an exception in this case.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still interested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filming will happen on Fri/Sat 16-17 January at studios in Aston near The Drum</li>
<li>They need some short interviews with the people involved and some footage of the band in the studio</li>
<li>There&#8217;s plenty of footage from the live shows already</li>
<li>They&#8217;re looking for something like the video of <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=HY54PDPEvvc">The Bays and Heritage Orchestra at the Liverpool Phil</a></li>
<li>The finished piece will be needed by the end of January</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can help then email Indy Hunjan at <span class="HcCDpe"><a href="mailto:indy@kalaphool.com">indy@kalaphool.com</a> or call her on 07977 449052.<br />
