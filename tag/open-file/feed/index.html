				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night <a title="Chris Unitt on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/ChrisUnitt/status/142392054620753920">I tweeted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By going to the right events around Brum, I reckon a determined ligger could score free mince pies every day between now and the 25th</p></blockquote>
<p>That was after reading about yet <em>another</em> event using the Christmas foodstuff to tempt people along &#8211; it&#8217;s become the audience development snack of choice.</p>
<p>However, I feel the need to back that up a bit (and you never know, I might even be right) so here are the mince pie-toting events I can recall off the top of my head:</p>
<p>1 Dec &#8211; <a href="http://www.bullring.co.uk/news/Hotel-Chocolat/Hotel-Chocolat-Christmas-Shopping-Evening">Hotel Chocolat Christmas Shopping event</a>. &#8216;Alternative&#8217; mince pies &#8211; close enough. Obviously it&#8217;s too late to make it down now, but I hear they were good<br />
2 Dec &#8211; <a title="The Art Bus" href="http://www.barber.org.uk/gallnight2011.html">The Art Bus</a><br />
3 Dec &#8211; <a title="Open File" href="http://openfile.org.uk/site-non-site/">Open File &#8211; Site/Non-site OR How many quarters does Birmingham have?</a><br />
3 Dec &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/loafonline/status/142609741527527427">Tom Baker says</a> he and <a href="http://twitter.com/greensnapper">Jane Baker</a> will be giving out free ones at <a href="http://www.northfieldecocentre.org/activities/events">Northfield Eco Centre</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll add to this list as and when I spot anything. If you know of any more (or if you&#8217;re organising an event and giving away mince pies) then let me know.</p>
<p>NB: I&#8217;m guessing most of the mince pies up for grabs are free, I might be very wrong about that. Take some cash with you just in case.</p>
