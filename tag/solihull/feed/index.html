<p>So who are Hive? <a title="Hive" href="http://hivecollective.org/" target="_blank">Hive</a> are a group of Birmingham based artists who began meeting regularly over a year ago to discuss ideas and share their experiences, eventually deciding they should showcase how artists collaborate and how artwork evolves. Chain Reaction, a visual art project, is a range of work including installation, audio-visual pieces, photography and artist books along with artefact&#8217;s and documentation exploring how they collaborated.</p>
<p>You can book a place at the free event by calling the Box Office 0121 704 6962 or just turn up on the evening.</p>
