				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3454" title="Adam Duffy If Looks Could Kill" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mailgooglecom.jpg" alt="Adam Duffy If Looks Could Kill" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Birmingham based designer Adam Duffy has won the Make Your Mark Young Brits Entrepreneur Creative Award for his company &#8216;Looks Can Kill&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 26 year old won the award  just over a year after setting up his business, which sells customized shoes. Customers can have their own name, photo or slogan printed on a trainer and delivered in a few days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adam puts the success of the business down to the creative control the company has, and not having to wait months for new designs to be produced, which is the case in standard footwear production.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The company has received support from both Business Link WM and Creative Launchpad, based in the Custard Factory. They currently employ two staff, frequently use part time staff and are looking to take on a sales manager in the future. Last year their turnover was approx £60,000 which is expected to dramatically increase this year with a concerted sales push as Adam has ambitious growth plans and is currently in talks with a number of large high street retailers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make Your Mark Enterprising Young Brits is an annual award set up by British Council that has been running for two years. Winners received a trophy and cheque for £1,000 from Chancellor Alistair Darling at a recent ceremony in London.</p>
