				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Juliette Blightman: A Year With No Head</strong> opens with a preview on 23 February at <a href="http://www.internationalprojectspace.org">International Project Space</a> from 5-7pm, and is ongoing until 2 April.</p>
<p>Working with film, performance and installation, the exhibition features a newly commissioned installation, which centres on a large-scale drawing, where the artist sketches out remembered images from  her previous installations, which she says act as &#8216;back-drops&#8217; for new works.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;often described  as engaging in a form of ‘romantic conceptualism’, her mixed-media  installations typically comprise arrangements of familiar domestic  objects which invite viewers to spend time with the work and shape their  own narratives from these components.</p>
<p>&#8230;As in previous work, Blightman is  interested in examining the subjectivity of ‘mental space’ and the  transformations of information that occur in any process attempting to  articulate it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blightman will also be producing a small printed publication containing various texts written by the artist over a period of several  months, along with a new collection of limited edition work which will be on sale through the gallery website.</p>
<p>International Project Space is open Wednesdays 12 – 7pm &amp; Thursday-Saturday 12– 5pm, and located at <a href="http://www.biad.bcu.ac.uk/about/bournville.htm">BIAD School of Art Bournville</a>.</p>
