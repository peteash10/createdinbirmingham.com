<p><a href="http://creativerepublic.org.uk">Creative Republic</a> managed to snatch victory from defeat the other night &#8211; the star turn couldn&#8217;t make the &#8216;<a href="http://creativerepublic.org.uk/masterclass-wolff">Creative Masterclass with Michael Wolff</a>&#8216; so instead we were given a chance to ponder what the Birmingham&#8217;s presentation of our very important (as we&#8217;re constantly being told at the mo) creative scene.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.steflewandowski.com/">Stef Lewandowski</a> kicked things off with a pretty scathing presentation of Birmingham from a tourist-eye view.Â  He had walked the city, camera in hand, trying (and generally failing) to find signs of creativity. He&#8217;s keen to point out that his negativity was slightly exaggerated but it was interesting that the vast majority of his criticisms went unchallenged.</p>
<p>Stef&#8217;s presentation is online.Â  The slides are good quality but you&#8217;ll have to excuse the audio in places:</p>
<div id="__ss_591143" style="width: 425px; text-align: center;"><a style="font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;" title="Birmingham Ambient Creativity Audit" href="http://www.slideshare.net/aeioux/birmingham-ambient-creativity-audit-presentation?type=powerpoint">Birmingham Ambient Creativity Audi</a></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="355" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=birmingham-ambient-creativity-audit-1221033120961893-9&amp;stripped_title=birmingham-ambient-creativity-audit-presentation" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="355" src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=birmingham-ambient-creativity-audit-1221033120961893-9&amp;stripped_title=birmingham-ambient-creativity-audit-presentation" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><img style="visibility:hidden;width:0px;height:0px;" src="http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyMjExNDUwMTEyMTUmcHQ9MTIyMTE*NTAyMDU*OSZwPTEwMTkxJmQ9Jm49Jmc9MiZ*PSZvPTdjOGI3MGQzZGMzYTQ4NzNiNzdlMDhmODg3Y2VmMTQw.gif" border="0" alt="" width="0" height="0" /></p>
<p>Sat in groups, we were then given the chance to chew over some of the points raised before reporting back to the rest of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">class</span> people there.</p>
<p>The chat has continued away from the event though.</p>
<ul>
<li>As well as uploading the slides and audio, Stef has put up a blog post called &#8216;<a href="http://www.steflewandowski.com/2008/09/a-creative-director-for-birmingham/">A creative director for Birmingham?</a>&#8216; with many of the photos used, text to explain them and a few extra thoughts too.Â  The comments following his post are worth a read too.</li>
<li>Graphiquillan wasn&#8217;t at the event but the subject of Stef&#8217;s talk chimed with her, prompting musings on the subject of &#8216;<a href="http://graphiquillan.wordpress.com/2008/09/10/finding-the-creative-needles-in-birminghams-haystack/">finding the creative needles in Birmingham&#8217;s haystack</a>&#8216;.</li>
<li>Paul Groves&#8217; post &#8216;<a href="http://grovesmedia.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/creating-a-stir-in-birmingham/">Creating a stir in Birmingham</a>&#8216; rounds up the thinking and suggests that despite &#8220;a lack of clarity and vision in recent times&#8221; we now seem to be getting  &#8220;the sort of lively and informed discussion that is long overdue&#8221;.</li>
<li>Dave Harte has picked up Stef&#8217;s theme on his Birmingham Post blog with &#8216;<a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2008/09/birmingham-the-uncreative-city.html">Birmingham &#8211; The Uncreative City?</a>&#8216; suggesting that, as well as making some good moves in rejuvenating the city, mistakes have been made &#8211; privatising public spaces, pricing out independent retail and approving uninspiring architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is for some of the thoughts collected over the course of the evening (and since) to go towards informing a future event with Michael Wolff and perhaps a submission to the <a href="http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/">Big City Plan</a> itself.Â  There&#8217;s still plenty of time for anyone to join the discussion.</p>
