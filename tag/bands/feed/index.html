				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just had an email from Heather at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/forerunnerrecords">Forerunner Records</a> saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m currently compiling an article for FEED industry magazine about female fronted bands in Birmingham.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to interview (via email) as many female fronted Birmingham bands as possible to feature and maybe review for this article I&#8217;m writing. They should contact me at <a href="mailto:forerunnerrecords@hotmail.com">forerunnerrecords@hotmail.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So if that&#8217;s you, or someone you know, or a local band you know of then get in touch with her.</p>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="  http://www.myspace.com/forerunnerrecords">Forerunner Records&#8217; MySpace</a> tells that they are:</p>
<blockquote><p>the official record label of Matthew Boulton College in Birmingham. We currently offer our services to existing students, and have special events to search for emerging talent in the 14-16 age group</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is interesting.Â  It looks like they&#8217;re going to get going in time for the start of the new academic year (that&#8217;s Sept 08).</p>
<p>Also, apologies for the childish and obvious title of this post.</p>
