<p>Getting to wander around Curzon Street Station (although there&#8217;s some good stuff in there, I have to admit I was excited enough about the building itself), finally making it over to <a title="The Lombard Method" href="http://www.thelombardmethod.org/">The Lombard Method</a>, <a href="http://grand-union.co.uk/wp/2011/direct-from-this-window-117%C2%BA-south-east-a-view-from-the-bosphorus/">Simon Faithfull&#8217;s window piece</a> at Grand Union, meeting the guys behind BAZ (and <a href="http://athleticotorturedartistsfc.tumblr.com/">Athletico Tortured Artists</a>), <a title="Crowd 6" href="http://crowd6.org.uk/">Crowd 6</a>&#8216;s exhibition and all sorts of other bits and pieces.</p>
<p>Not that it was all my cup of tea, necessarily, but then that&#8217;s all part of the fun too. <a href="http://curatorcharlie.blogspot.com/2011/10/few-others-at-event.html">Charlie Levine&#8217;s written a post of her own</a> about what&#8217;s going on &#8211; she&#8217;s got pictures.</p>
<p><a title="The Event" href="http://the-event.org/">The Event</a> is on until 30 October. If you don&#8217;t know your way round (and even if you do) it&#8217;s worth joining one of the <a href="http://the-event.org/blog/public-tours-2/">guided tours</a>.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.stereographic.co.uk/blog/?p=30">stereographic &#8211; Scribble Diary</a><br />
Stereographic have posted up some new examples of their work on their blog (including their work for Birmingham Opera Company and New Art Gallery Walsall) but it&#8217;s things like Sam&#8217;s scribble diary here which I like seeing and gives more of an insight into what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes (monsters and beer, by the looks of it)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/2008/10/08/platform-video/">Platform 01</a><br />
&#8220;PLATFORM 01 was a multi-media collection of work by predominantly local artists, and featured contributions from painters, photographers, sculptors, printmakers and digital media artists&#8221;.  It was filmed in the Custard Factory Gallery</li>
<li><a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/2008/10/08/punch-winter-2008/">Punch Winter 2008</a><br />
Punch Record&#8217;s winter schedule is out</li>
<li><a href="http://athleticotorturedartistsfc.tumblr.com/">Athletico Tortured Artists FC</a><br />
This is brilliant (although apparently my hair is to tidy for me to ever get a call-up &#8211; fairy nuff)</li>
<li><a href="http://typedrawer.blogspot.com/">The Type Drawer</a><br />
&#8220;We are working on a scene whereby a magical Type drawer explains some of Baskerville&#8217;s and Birmingham&#8217;s industrial achievements&#8221; &#8216;We&#8217; being Sarah Carter, Howie Barker, Tommy Morrison and Alex Bermingham &#8211; the people behind this blog and a creative team working on Baskerville The Movie</li>
