				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a classical musician, I have often found that contemporary music is met with extreme unnecessary prejudice from most audiences, and even from the musicians themselves. However, we have come a long way since Arnold Schoenberg and his band of merry Serialist pranksters.</p>
<p>We are lucky to live in city so diverse that there is music and art of all types so readily available to us. In the music scene, some artists aren&#8217;t just available, they are begging for audiences to experience their music. I have sourced some excellent music that is being performed in Birmingham in the next month, alone. This is just a tiny snapshot into the world of music and performance that is not achieving quite the audience members that it rightly deserves.</p>
<p>With the news of the cuts happening in the next few years in Birmingham, it is now that we should be celebrating what we, as artists, have to offer. The best way, I feel, to do this, is to see everything. Go to concerts and experience what has been provided to us, show the people in charge of money in this city what, we, as music fans need.</p>
<p><strong>Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical, dance, technology</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the the CBSO&#8217;s (City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra) biggest projects of the 2010/2011 is it&#8217;s performance of Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Rite of Spring</em>. A formidable and excellent piece in it&#8217;s own right, the creators at the CBSO and Symphony Hall have fused together music, dance and technology :</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience an astonishing interplay between reality and fantasy as dancer Julia Mach’s extraordinary live performance interacts, through the magic of digital wizardry, with real-time, computer generated stereoscopic projections, translated into a virtual reality space with the aid of 3D spectacles for the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; THSH</p>
<p>The 30-minutes piece is preceded by Varese&#8217;s <em>Tuning Up</em> and Ligeti&#8217;s <em>Lontano</em> for large orchestra, a distant and warm piece which plays with with the make-up of unconventional diatonic harmony.</p>

<p><strong>Birmingham Contemporary Music Group &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>The BCMG is the city&#8217;s orchestra dedicated entirely to the performance of contemporary and new music. Made up of players from the CBSO, the flexible organisation has grown in the one of the world&#8217;s most fore-thinking ensembles of new music. They play regular concerts at the CBSO Centre on Berkley Street, B1, as well as touring all over the city.</p>
<p>The percussion players are performing what promises to be an excellent concert of Varese and Xenakis on the 25th March at Yardley Old Church as well as this Sunday (13th March).</p>
<p>Oliver Knussen conducts his own memorial work <em>Requiem &#8211; Songs for Sue</em> as well as pieces by Morton Feldman and Harrison Birtwistle</p>
<p><strong>Steve Reich and Thomas Ades. &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>This week, Friday 11th March, Symphony Hall have also included another excellent performance of contemporary. The London Sinfonietta, one of the world&#8217;s leading orchestra for contemporary classical music are visiting Birmingham, performing Steve<br />
Reich&#8217;s <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em>, complete with 4 grand pianos and 5 marimbas. The minimalist style of Steve Reich is used in many sources of media, films, adverts and television, purely for the fact it is accessible to both musician and audience alike. Conductor Thomas Ades? starts the concert with his own In Seven Days, a collaborative project with filmmaker Tal Rosner and is based on the Creation.</p>
<p>Tickets start from £10 (or £5 on the day for U25s)</p>
<p><strong>The Irrepressibles: Mirror Mirror<em> &#8211; contemporary pop, performance art, collaboration, crossover</em></strong></p>
<p>Another gig at the heart of Birmingham, the Town Hall, <em>The Irrepressibles</em> are a 10-piece orchestra committed to stretching the boundaries of conventional performance. Lead by singer, Jamie McDermot, they perform hearty indie music with a set up of orchestral musicians as accompaniment.</p>
<p>This show is in conjunction with Fierce Festival and is at Town Hall, 22nd March, £15</p>
<p><strong>SOUNDkitchen &#8211; <em>contemporary, sound, experimental, collaboration</em></strong></p>
<p>SOUNDkitchen is a new group made up of music graduates from the University of Birmingham. Their “STONEsoup” concert at the MAC was met with rave reviews and are following up with a collaborative event with Balkanic Eruption, promoters of Klezmer and Balkan music within the city. Playing at the Hare and Hounds, B14, the concert focuses on expanding sound using technology and live instruments, it will be followed by a live laptop performance from Garfield Benjamin.</p>

<p><strong>Birmingham Conservatoire &#8211; <em>classical contemporary, premieres, fusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Like the Uni of Birmingham, the Conservatoire has one of the most developed composition departments in the country. The students are exceptionally talented and lucky for us the concerts are generally very cheap and on a regular basis. This month as well as a student showcase of new music (held on the 18th March and conducted by the great Edwin Roxburgh) we see the <em>Frontiers</em> department of Conservatoire play host to world-renowned electronic violinist, Barbara Luneberg. This young talent has worked with some of the world&#8217;s best contemporary composers. On the 14th March, Luneberg is to perform works written for her by young composers from all over Europe, this will also include a premiere of work by VT of the Conservatoire, Ed Bennett.</p>
