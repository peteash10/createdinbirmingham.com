<p>The Photography Collective and <a href="http://www.birminghamphotospace.co.uk/">Birmingham Photospace</a> have teamed up in association with <a href="http://www.rhubarb-rhubarb.net">Rhubarb Rhubarb</a>, to bring us <a href="http://www.contactexhibition.co.uk">Contact</a>. From 3-18 September the Rhubarb East Gallery will play host to a collection of seven emerging photographers working in the West Midlands.</p>
<p>Curated by Kathryn Kliszat from <a href="http://www.light-house.co.uk/">Light House</a>, exhibiting artists are <a href="http://www.gwbenson.co.uk/dev/index.php">gwbenson</a>, <a href="http://www.jimmy-photo.com/">Ian &amp; Mark James (Jimmy Photo)</a>, Hannah Rumsby, Jo Hallington, Jasroop Grewal, <a href="http://www.ritafletcher.com/">Rita Fletcher</a> and Matt Murtagh.</p>
<blockquote><p>The variety of styles and formats challenges the viewer to consider how  contact is made between objects both animate and inanimate, between the  past and present, between analogue and digital and between photographer  and subject.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exhibition will be open Thursday &#8211; Sunday, 11.00am – 5.30pm, and there will also be an Artists’  Talk on Thursday 9 September, at 6.30pm, allowing members of the public to meet the photographers and discuss the stories behind these powerful images.</p>

Not quite sure what the deal is with this one. They&#8217;ve got a DIY print studio and are looking for people to submit designs for them to use on T-shirts and so on. A physical shop is apparently coming in summer 09, in the meantime they&#8217;re up online with a website (coming soon) and this blog</li>

The next meeting about this is on Tues 14 October at 6.30pm in the Library cafe, Birmingham city centre.  Seek out the Birmingham Flickr group for how the discussion about this is going; this is a link to the draft vision they&#8217;ve prepared</li>

The Flip Animation folk put out a reminder for the Animation Forum WM&#8217;s Grads on Walls event on Monday (good to see people talking up other people&#8217;s events &#8211; a very smart thing to do, I&#8217;d say)</li>

&#8220;The 500 people who have made it through this year&#8217;s Style Search will be whittled down to just ten this weekend at a special party at Gatecrasher&#8221;.  Why am I linking to this? Um&#8230; just spreading the joy I guess</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been a discussion bubbling away in the past few weeks about establishing a dedicated space for photography in Birmingham.Â  Much of this has been taking place among members of the Birmingham Flickr group.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s to be a get-together to try and take things further:</p>
<blockquote><p>A small group of us are getting together on Wednesday 17th September 2008 at 6.30pm in Rooty&#8217;s (the Custard Factory) to discuss some of the ideas that have arisen from our Flickr discussion on setting up a group to push for the establishment of a Photospace for Birmingham.</p></blockquote>
<p>For background info you can see the <a href="http://photobirmingham.blogspot.com/">PhotoBirmingham</a> blog and the original (and still ongoing) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/birmingham/discuss/72157606746067676/">discussion on Flickr</a>.</p>
