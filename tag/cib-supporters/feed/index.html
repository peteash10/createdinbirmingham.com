				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s the last day to <strong>become a CiB Supporter for a bargain £50</strong> instead of the usual £75.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/cib-supporters/support-cib/">Sign up here now</a></strong></p>
<p>The offer was meant to end yesterday, but I&#8217;m going to extend it until midnight tonight (or whatever time I wake up and flip the switch tomorrow morning).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/cib-supporters/">everyone who&#8217;s signed up so far</a>. You&#8217;ll be pleased to know the special Christmas cards (designed by band new crafty duo <a href="http://twitter.com/ladyandsmall">Lady and Small</a>) are being delivered today, so you&#8217;ll get them sometime next week.</p>
<p>There seem to be two reasons people are signing up:</p>
<ol>
<li>As far as advertising goes it&#8217;s ridiculously cheap (see <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/cib-supporters/support-cib/">details of the offer here</a>)</li>
<li>People seem to like CiB and want to ensure that it can carry on</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note &#8211; this offer is for online sign-ups only. If you can&#8217;t pay online and need invoicing then I can do that but it&#8217;ll have to be for the full £75.</p>
<p>Two more notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to be a &#8216;creative&#8217; person, organisation or whatever to sign-up &#8211; anyone&#8217;s welcome</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve got nothing to advertise but want to support anyway (as a couple of people have done) then you can use <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/plugins/oiopub-direct/uploads/FjBEFz_support-cib.jpg" rel="lightbox[4522]">this banner</a> (right click-save as) and this link &#8211; http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/cib-supporters/support-cib/ &#8211; when you&#8217;re asked for them</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting today there&#8217;s a new way to support Created in Birmingham and help make it sustainable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called CiB Supporters, costs £75 for 1 year and <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/plugins/oiopub-direct/purchase.php">you can sign up here now</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>But wait, there&#8217;s an introductory offer!</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes indeedy. Until 10 December (or the first 50 takers, whichever comes first) you can <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/plugins/oiopub-direct/purchase.php">sign up for just £50</a>! Bearing in mind it costs £50 to advertise on the site for a week, that&#8217;s dirt cheap. (NB &#8211; The offer is only open to online sign-ups &#8211; if you need invoicing it&#8217;ll cost the full £75. <a href="mailto:createdinbirmingham@gmail.com">Email us here for that</a>).</p>
<p><strong>In return, you get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your advert/logo (125×125 pixel block) shown on rotation in CiB’s sidebar and linking  to your website</li>
<li>Your advert/logo shown on the CiB Supporters page and linking  to your website</li>
<li>A mention in that month&#8217;s &#8216;Thank You&#8217; post</li>
<li>Listing on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/CreatedinBirmingham?v=app_4949752878">Supporters tab</a> on the CiB Facebook Page</li>
<li>Your Twitter name (if you have one) in the <a href="http://twitter.com/createdinbrum/cib-supporters">CiB Supporters List</a></li>
<li>A specially commissioned Christmas card (if you’re a supporter prior to 10 December and you provide your address)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition you’ll be helping to make Created in Birmingham sustainable and (although it shouldn’t need saying) you’ll have our thanks too. In fact, we&#8217;ll try and find extra ways to thank our supporters over the year.</p>
<p>Please note, if you want to change your advert/logo over the course of the year it&#8217;ll cost an extra £15 per change.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already had a few takers which is superb (and means we&#8217;re definitely sending some Christmas cards). You can see those nice peoples in the sidebar on the right already.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of asking myself a few questions about this, in a contrived way of explaining things a little more. If you have any more questions then please <a href="mailto:createdinbirmingham@gmail.com">drop me an email</a> or leave a comment.</p>
<p><strong>Why this approach?</strong></p>
<p>We think £75 should put large and small organisations on a similar footing. From our point of view it&#8217;s a lot simpler to manage a programme like this than to run weekly advertising (although we&#8217;ll be doing that too). We&#8217;ve eschewed the option of means-related charging &#8211; partly because it&#8217;s trickier to administrate, partly because it&#8217;s nice how the CiB format treats small and large (roughly) the same.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this aimed at?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>CiB helps promote a lot of arts/cultural/etc organisations in the city &#8211; I&#8217;m hoping that they&#8217;ll chip in to help ensure that there&#8217;s an outlet for their work.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a lot of companies that I&#8217;m sure would love to market themselves to arts organisations and/or the sort of audience that Created in Birmingham attracts.</p>
<p>Finally, on a cost per impression basis, £75 is incredibly cheap &#8211; it&#8217;s sale of the century, folks!</p>
<p><strong>What about other people who want to support the site in some way?</strong></p>
<p>People are welcome to use a photo of themselves and link to, for instance, their Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn profiles. Otherwise, we&#8217;re looking at other ways for people to support the site &#8211; through the many and varied CiB Projects, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Does being a CiB Supporter guarantee me editorial coverage?</strong></p>
<p>Just the mention in the monthly &#8216;Thank You&#8217; round-up.</p>
