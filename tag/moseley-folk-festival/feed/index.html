				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve spotted a few groups looking for helpful volunteers. Here are a few you might want to take a look at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theflyovershow.com/">The Flyover Show</a> is taking place this Saturday, 18th of August, and are looking for a few extra pairs of hands to help out. Each year the space under the Hockley flyover is transformed into an arena for this day of hip hop, reggae and jazz. For more information please email <a href="mailto:clareedwards@mac.com">Clare Edwards</a></p>
<p>Light House Media Centre in Wolverhampton are searching for <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/what-we-do/ambassador-scheme/">Ambassadors</a>. In return for a range of benefits Ambassadors promote the venue to their friends, colleagues and online networks.</p>
<p>Every year <a href="http://oxjambrum.org.uk/">Oxjam Brum</a> takeover a bunch of city centre venues to put on a one-day festival of live music with local bands and artists, with all proceeds going to Oxfam. They are always on the lookout for all kinds of creatives, including photographers, designers, artists&#8230; and even cake decorators, who would like to help them put on a bigger and better show. If this sounds like you please contact them <a href="http://oxjambrum.org.uk/contact/">here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the local festival season due to it&#8217;s chilled out vibe and wonderful location, <a href="http://www.moseleyfolk.co.uk/">Moseley Folk Festival</a> returns on the 31st August and 1st and 2nd September. They are currently recruiting a team of friendly, motivated stewards to help the weekend run smoothly. In return for two 4 hour shifts volunteers can enjoy the rest of the 3 day festival. Find out more <a href="http://www.moseleyfolk.co.uk/contact-us/volunteer-opportunities/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> is the annual weekend of all things artistic in Birmingham, when the city attempts to show off the breadth and depth of it&#8217;s creative and cultural sector. It advertises itself as the UK&#8217;s biggest free arts festival, and relies on a team of volunteers. Taking place during the second weekend in September, which this year is the 7th to the 9th, applications for volunteers have closed but if you&#8217;d like to add yourself to the reserve list details can be found <a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/volunteers/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tedxbrum.org/">TEDxBrum</a> brings the renowned series of talks and ideas by inspirational speakers to Birmingham. After a successful inaugural event this year they are currently <a href="http://www.tedxbrum.org/blog/tedx-brum-team-2013-we-want-you/">recruiting a team</a> for 2013. Among roles in production, marketing and communication perhaps of interest is &#8216;Non-Speaker Content Curation&#8217; which will help expand the performances and exhibitions which will take place on the day.</p>
<p>Finally, another music festival, <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com">Supersonic</a>, is looking for volunteers. Taking place in Digbeth in October, Supersonic is curated by Birmingham-based promoters Capsule. For more information contact <a href="mailto:volunteer@capsule.org.uk">volunteer@capsule.org.uk</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Metro&#8217;s <a href="http://westmidlandsblog.metro.co.uk/2008/08/this-weekend-wi.html">West Midlands Life blog</a> (fresh from <a href="http://westmidlandsblog.metro.co.uk/2008/08/by-philip-holym.html">giving Artsfest a rather unnecessary shoeing</a>) have reminded me of the Outer Sight film nights at <a href="http://www.livearts.co.uk/theedge.htm">The Edge</a> that I mentioned a while back and completely forgot to follow up on.</p>
<p>The next one is apparently on Saturday and:</p>
<blockquote><p>the very vague theme is â€˜French Fancies &amp; Freaky Kids Flicksâ€™. Expect weird film from psychedelic animator Vince Collins and even weirder music.Â  Entry is Â£2.50 with invite or Â£3.50 without; for more information, text OUTERSIGHT to 07887 956297, or e-mail <a href="mailto:outersight@live.com">outersight@live.com</a> to join the mailing list</p></blockquote>
<p>So if you&#8217;re not listening politely to another quite pleasant acoustic act at <a href="http://moseleyfolk.co.uk/">Moseley Folk Festival</a> then perhaps pop down to this.Â  Speaking of the <a href="http://moseleyfolk.co.uk/">Mofo Festival</a> (as no-one is calling it, thankfully) it kicks off today and I hear that kids&#8217; tickets have gone.Â  When I bought a ticket the other day (pay in cash at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/polarbearrecords1">Polar Bear</a> and avoid a hefty booking fee from some other outlets) they were going quick &#8211; apparently it looks like Saturday might sell out but there should be tickets on the door if you get down in time.</p>
