<p style="text-align: justify;">Friday, 05/06/09, 19:00</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten high-backed chairs, some seating elderly people and some seating younger people, spanned the back of the stage area at <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/about/the-door/" target="_blank">The Door</a>, the studio theatre at Birmingham Rep. Above this seating arrangement was a large screen, showing slow panoramics of the Birmingham skyline. In front of them, a gently-lit bed with a man lying down, a wheeled trolley next to him and a fan pointed at him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A short film entitled &#8220;Hats&#8221; began. The first shot panned out to show a woman, with coarse patchy hair and a massive grin cackling as she tried on the most extravagant yellow hat with massive straw brim. She looked into the camera and said, &#8220;Yes. This is me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At this point, I have to admit to no longer being able to see very well due to the large amounts of tears gushing down my face &#8211; so if my descriptions fall short somehow, I apologise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rosettalife.org/" target="_blank">Rosetta Life</a> is a charity dedicated to working with people who have life-threatening illnesses.  <a href="http://www.rosettalive.org/theatre/" target="_blank">“The Magical Glow of the Co Op”</a> was a rehearsed reading as part of the <a href="http://www.rosettalive.org/" target="_blank">Rosetta Live</a> celebrations that featured the work of two hospices; Birmingham St Mary’s Hospice in Selly Park and St Giles Hospice Whittington, near Lichfield. Working together, more than 30 hospice users generated a performance script that looked at the choices people face when dying and the difficulties they face when making these choices.  In the 10 chairs sat 3 professional actors (the fourth was lying on the bed), 6 hospice users and one care professional.  Throughout the reading hospice users took to the stage to perform alongside the professional actors which really added weight and poignancy (as well as some unexpected laughs) to the evening.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" title="John Flitcroft and Lucy Tuck" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3390/3601504302_2f88eeb252_o.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The performance finished with an aftershow discussion called ‘The Big Conversation – Let’s Talk About Living’.  The audience were invited to ask questions of the panel of hospice users who had taken part in the perfomance, health care practitioners and the actors who were still in character.  Until then, I had kept my eyes focused on the stage, hoping to hide anonymously at the edge of a row.  However once the lights went up, I really looked at the audience &#8211; at those people who had chosen to spend a night in the company of such a taboo subject.   The audience consisted of every economic/social/cultural background you can imagine, all sat in one small venue watching their loved ones perform, or the words of their lost loved one performed by their peers.  And there were no dry eyes.  Not one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel excited that Birmingham East and North PCT were brave enough not only to fund this project, but also to enable Birmingham to become the first UK city that is making steps to talk openly about how it&#8217;s citizens positively approach life as it draws to a close, as well as how they want to be remembered. Created in Birmingham has always highlighted exciting and relevant creative ventures linked to the city, and I can&#8217;t think of a more perfect project to write about in my first post proper.  Actors, hospice users, venue and funders are all citizens of Birmingham, breaking new and important (if at times uncomfortable) ground.  This was a performance that anyone touched by illness should see, not just the friends and families of those performing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The Magical Glow of the Co-op&#8221; was just one small part of the <a href="http://www.rosettalive.org/" target="_blank">Rosetta Live</a> celebration running throughout June. It culminates in a film premiere at <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Electric Cinema</a> on 29th June commencing at 6.00pm.  To book, please contact bookings@rosettalive.org &#8211; I know I&#8217;m going to be there.</p>
