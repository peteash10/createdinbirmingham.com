				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I went along to <a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/wolves">Wolverhampton Art Gallery</a> to hear about the Arts Council&#8217;s new national campaign for the arts &#8211; due to start in April 2010. Here&#8217;s the opening presentation that was delivered by Julie Eaglen, Arts Council WM&#8217;s Audience Development Officer.</p>

<p>The standout point from the presentation for me is this bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>… despite the significant efforts of arts organisations and the Arts Council to broaden audiences &#8211; and there has been, and is, some really excellent work going on &#8211; our statistics show that there has been no significant shift in the profile of people who engage with the arts over the past three years.</p>
<p>This means that we can&#8217;t simply continue doing more of the same; it&#8217;s not working. We need a new approach</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the presentation to see how this is to be achieved (and from the tone of language used, it <em>has to be </em>achieved), but in a nutshell there&#8217;ll be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a programme of arts engagement activity</li>
<li>a large-scale broadcast, media and marketing campaign</li>
<li>targeting of an identified group of 12.8 million people who currently have some interest in the arts but have expressed an inclination/desire to do or see more</li>
<li>a new national arts web portal</li>
</ul>
<p>Locally, the programme is being coordinated by <a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk">Audiences Central</a>. Each region has been asked to pick a hot-spot to focus their activity on and in the West Mids it&#8217;ll be the Black Country. It&#8217;s hoped that the rest of the region will benefit from a &#8216;halo effect&#8217; from this activity and from the national media campaign.</p>
<p>On this last point, the idea is to develop a brand and kitemark that venues, promoters, organisations, etc will want to apply to their work in the same way that many food producers have voluntarily taken up the 5-a-day brand.</p>
<p>Success will be measured via the <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/research_and_statistics/4828.aspx">national Taking Part survey</a> and the <a href="http://www.sportengland.org/research/active_people_survey.aspx">Active Peoples survey</a> (for local authorities that use an <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/research_and_statistics/6230.aspx">indicator called NI11</a> &#8211; hopefully that&#8217;ll mean something to someone).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the budget for the national campaign is but, after much talk of &#8216;limited resources&#8217;, it transpired that the amount of cash available for the West Mids (and therefore the Black Country) is £200,000 over two years. Consequently there was much talk about partnership working and the reliance on organisations finding a benefit in piggybacking on the national campaign.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Arts Council have set up a website at <a href="http://www.helloart.org.uk">Hello Art</a> where you can find out a little more and sign up for future updates. It&#8217;d be also be worth following <a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/">Audiences Central</a> for updates about the West Mids focus.</p>
<p>Finally (and because someone asked me to keep count):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentions of <a href="http://www.inthebigpicture.co.uk/">The Big Picture</a> &#8211; 7</li>
<li>Mentions of the <a href="http://www.5aday.nhs.uk/topTips/default.html">5-a-day campaign</a> &#8211; 7</li>
</ul>
