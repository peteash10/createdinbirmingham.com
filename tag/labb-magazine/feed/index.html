				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://karenkiely.com/">Karen Kiely</a>&#8216;s been looking at Birmingham&#8217;s fashion blogging scene, which is something she&#8217;ll apparently be exploring as part of her <a href="http://www.bcu.ac.uk/pme/school-of-media/courses/social-media-pgcert-pgdip-ma">Social Media as Culture</a> module on her Masters. She&#8217;s picked out <a href="http://www.stylebirmingham.com/" target="_blank">Style Birmingham</a>, <a href="http://uberbrum.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Uber Brum</a> and <a href="http://thedollonfashion.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Doll on Fashion</a>.</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d have a root around for a few others.</p>
<p><a href="http://eyethief.blogspot.com/">Rajmeena</a> posts sketches, there are dribs and drabs on the <a href="http://www.retailbirmingham.co.uk/category/blog/">Retail Birmingham blog</a>, <a href="http://wecreate.org.uk/">We Create</a> have a blog that occasionally features &#8216;about young British fashion designers&#8217; although not so much recently. <a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/">LABB Magazine&#8217;s blog</a> goes in for loads of pics. <a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/">Fused</a> cover fashion from time to time too.</p>
<p>Selina Jervis is from Birmingham but not around the city so much as far as I can tell. Her <a href="http://flyingsaucer.typepad.com/">Flying Saucer blog</a> has been popular for a while and it&#8217;s interesting to see they&#8217;ve recently snapped her up as a guest blogger on <a href="http://www.browsebullring.co.uk/blogs/">Browse Bullring</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers to <a href="http://twitter.com/jim_b">Jim</a> for pointing me towards <a href="http://vintagereflection.wordpress.com/">Vintage Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>There must be more out there&#8230; (*hint*)</p>

<p>In case you haven&#8217;t heard, last week was <a href="http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/">London Fashion Week</a>. And while some of us can only dream of attending the glamorous shows, the closest we can get to our fashion fantasies is through various blogs and Twitter updates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Birmingham designer <a href="http://www.damianmarquez.com/">Damian Marquez</a> was invited to showcase his S/S11 collection as a part of <a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/">LABB Magazine</a>’s London Fashion Week showcase event, &#8220;<a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/2010/09/labb-emerge-windows-ss-11.html">Emerge</a>&#8221; which took place on Monday at Hoxton Factory.</p>
<blockquote><p>The collection is made  up of playful tailoring, jersey wear and swimwear. Damian, who launched  his design career at Costa Rica Fashion week in 2009, hopes that this  new collection will follow in the footsteps of his A/W 2010 range which  was quickly snapped up by stylists and magazines internationally</p></blockquote>
<p>The collection was both designed and produced from Damian&#8217;s Harborne shop, while those beautifully airy shots from his S/S11 lookbook (above) are also the work of Birmingham photographer <a href="http://www.garazi.co.uk/">Garazi Gardener</a>.</p>

<p>This fresh faced quarterly magazine has been put together by a small team who have created, produced and printed <a href="http://issuu.com/george.eko/docs/texturelabbsamplebook">LABB magazine</a> in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Aiming to harvest and showcase emerging talent in art, fashion and photography, LABB allows readers to explore something new as oppose to the same churned out work seen in fellow coffee table mags.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fashion, it&#8217;s like a science, you always want to push the limits,  find something new, but its always based on the existing. Not everyone  who works in a lab wears a white jacket&#8230; WELCOME TO OUR LABB!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://issuu.com/george.eko/docs/texturelabbsamplebook">Issue 1, Volume 2</a> is currently available, with Volume 3 on the way for September. In the meantime they&#8217;ve also got a blog, <a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/">LABB Loves</a>, which is great if, like me, you like flicking through dozens of highly stylised fashion photography.</p>
