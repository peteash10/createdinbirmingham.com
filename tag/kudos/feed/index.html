				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Katie/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-5.jpg" alt="" />Following a recent announcement that BBC&#8217;s drama &#8216;Survivors&#8217; will relocate to the West Midlands, <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk" target="_blank">Screen WM</a> has announced today that  they are investing  in the next series of <a href="http://www.kudosproductions.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kudos Film and Television</a>’s major international TV drama, Hustle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3674" title="hustle" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hustle.jpg" alt="hustle" width="600" height="116" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hustle.jpg 600w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hustle-300x58.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The investment means that Hustle will relocate to Birmingham, and the city will provide a new backdrop for the drama which is broadcast across the world. This is a major coup for the city and forms part of a wider strategy by Screen WM to secure and create a more sustainable screen media sector in the West Midlands. The series will bring an estimated £1.2 million into the regional economy and will provide jobs for local crew.</p>
<p>The Hustle team are due to move to Birmingham and will be living in the city for the duration of the filming. In addition to financial investment, Screen WM have played a significant role in attracting the new series of Hustle to the West Midlands, working closely with Film Birmingham, providing locations and crew support. The producers were attracted to the West Midlands on the basis of the region’s diverse locations, excellent facilities and experienced crew.</p>
<p>Simon Crawford Collins, Joint Managing Director of Kudos said: “We are hugely excited about Hustle’s move to Birmingham.  It’s a transformed city whose cool new locations have rarely been used for TV dramas and we will hope it will become a hub for Kudos’s output for many years to come.”</p>
