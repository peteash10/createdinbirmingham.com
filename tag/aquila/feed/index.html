				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>5 SOLDIERS: The Body is the Front Line</em> by <a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk">Rosie Kay Dance Company</a> is a contemporary dance piece that was commissioned for last year&#8217;s<a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>. It toured to good reviews and was especially well received by the military.</p>
<p>Rosie Kay received funding through the Arts Council&#8217;s <a title="DCD programme" href="http://www.dcdprogramme.org.uk/">Digital Content Development programme</a> to do something interestingly digital with it and <strong><a href="http://www.5soldiers.co.uk">5 SOLDIERS &#8211; Interactive Film</a></strong> is the result.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.5soldiers.co.uk"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9319" title="5 SOLDIERS - Interactive Film" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/5-SOLDIERS-Interactive-Film-1.jpg" alt="5 SOLDIERS - Interactive Film" width="550" height="399" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/5-SOLDIERS-Interactive-Film-1.jpg 550w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/5-SOLDIERS-Interactive-Film-1-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p><a title="5 SOLDIERS" href="http://www.5soldiers.co.uk">Head to the website</a> and you can watch the &#8216;director&#8217;s cut&#8217; of the piece the whole way through or, at any point, you can click the name of the camera angle to continue watching the piece from one of 13 different viewpoints (including each dancer&#8217;s point of view).</p>
<p>Have a play with it and, if you reckon it&#8217;s interesting, please use the Twitter and Facebook buttons at the bottom of the page to let others know.</p>
<p>I should say that this is something that <a href="http://meshedmedia.com">Meshed Media</a> (my company) has been involved in, along with <a href="http://www.aquila-tv.com/">Aquila TV</a> and <a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk">Rosie Kay Dance Company</a>. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://meshedmedia.com/developing-5-soldiers/">written more about it on the Meshed Media blog</a> and freelance web developer Daniel Davies has written about his involvement in <a href="http://www.danux.co.uk/2011/03/04/5-soldiers/">the technical side of the project</a> too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I went along to a meeting  at Birmingham Chamber of Commerce to see what&#8217;s being done about forming the new Local Enterprise Partnerships (you may recall I mentioned these the other week). I might write up the event sometime, but I&#8217;ve got a feeling that things will have moved on again before I get the chance, so I&#8217;ll just pull out a couple of threads here.</p>
<p>I went along to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>what kinds of issues are being discussed</li>
<li>how the artistic/cultural/wider creative interests of the city are being represented</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as the issues being discussed are concerned, things seem to still be at an early stage. The main topic of discussion was what we might want a LEP to be responsible for and the responses were fairly wide-ranging. Bear in mind that the deadline for proposals to government is a month away and that other large areas around the country have already come to agreement and are settled and you start to get the picture.</p>
<p>From my position as a lay person in all of this, there seemed to have been two widely held opinions from the business folk in the room &#8211; we need to get on and do something fast and the local political infighting needs to stop.</p>
<p>The latter was put rather more strongly by some, but you didn&#8217;t sit through a two hour meeting in which that was the only light relief, so I&#8217;m keeping the exact phrases to myself. Next week I&#8217;m going to go to a nice exhibition or something and report back on that.</p>
<p>As for creative industries representation, a rough headcount revealed six of us &#8211; Lee and Rachel from <a href="http://www.fullrange.co.uk/">Fullrange</a>, Julia from <a href="http://www.aquila-tv.com/">Aquila</a>, Lorraine from <a href="http://www.weavemarketing.co.uk/">Weave Marketing</a> and <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/">Creative Republic</a>, a lady from <a href="http://www.toye.com">Toye Kenning &amp; Spencer</a> (I can&#8217;t find her name just now) and myself. There may well have been others.</p>
<p>I also clocked <a href="http://www.hammonds.com/Default.aspx?sID=14&amp;cID=50400&amp;ctID=36">Anne O&#8217;Meara</a> who deserves a mention. She&#8217;s a fantastically experienced property/regeneration lawyer (and my one-time boss, as it goes) who also chairs the CBSO and has been named by Arts &amp; Business as <a href="http://www.artsandbusiness.org.uk/News/2010/july/midlands-cultural-champions.aspx">a Midlands Cultural Champion</a>. She was there too and a good reminder that there are some people on the business/financial side of town that are committed to the arts/culture cause too.</p>
