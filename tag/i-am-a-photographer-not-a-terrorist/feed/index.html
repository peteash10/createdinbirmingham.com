<p>Their <a href="http://www.theimagefile.com/web/suttoncoldfieldcollege/exhibition.html">end of year show</a> will be for one night at Masonic Buildings on  Severn  Street, Birmingham on 25th June from 6.30pm till 9.00pm and the after show  party will  be at the same venue from 9.00pm till late, by invitation  only.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some background to the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>The students, this year, have chosen to voice their displeasure and  resentment at the draconian and ill-conceived Section 44 of the  Terrorism Act. Many of the students have been accosted and questioned by  the police and security guards whilst in the act of taking photographs  for assignments in the course. Also, many of the public have confronted  the students during their photographic activities accusing them of  potential child offences even though they were clearly photographing a  tree or derelict buildings etc.</p></blockquote>
