				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An interesting an impassioned polemic from James Yarker of <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> appeared on The Birmingham Post&#8217;s site the other day, and includes this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Letâ€™s get to those rooms above pubs, street corners, concert halls, village halls, school halls, libraries, fields and theatres, where real live people are performing for real live audiences and sharing a moment in time together, participating in a social exchange that celebrates an act of creativity engaged for its own sake, prompted by values outside basic commerce. Letâ€™s go and be with other people, sharing a communal moment of beauty and provocation, which will dissolve as soon as it is done and remain precious for that very reason.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/birmingham-business-news/media-marketing-news/2008/06/09/stan-s-cafe-leads-the-call-for-a-return-to-creativity-65233-21043053/">rest of the piece</a> richly deserves your attention.</p>
<p>And it begs the question, what was the last artistic performance you took a risk on?Â  For me it was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5beZNuJkExA">Society of Futopia</a> which, although it bemused and bored me in equal measure, I was very glad to have seen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A free, one-off performance will take place at <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/news/5/2008/new_ikon_eastside_space/">Ikon Eastside</a> at 10pm on Tuesday 3 June.</p>
<p>The Society of Futopia has been developed by four final year students at BIAD, Birmingham City University and will take place during the <a href="http://www.newgenerationarts.co.uk/">New Generation Arts Festival</a>.  One of the artists, <a href="http://garethbarnett.blogspot.com/">Gareth Burnett</a> did have a blog he was using as a diary &#8211; there&#8217;s some interesting stuff there but that seems to have petered out.  According to the artists:</p>
<blockquote><p>The performance is rooted in Futurist Theatre and mixes live performance with film and animation; at its core it is an exploration of the human condition. There is a level of interaction with the audience; instead of conventional lighting the audience will be given torches to discover the characters themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, rather more excitingly:</p>
<blockquote><p>In violence we worship beauty. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. This is the truth according to the Society of Futopia.</p></blockquote>
<p>The performance will also be filmed and exhibited alongside a set of photographs based around science and genetics in the future, religious structures and the human condition. This exhibition runs from 17th June &#8211; 20th June.  On the subject of filming, here&#8217;s a trailer they prepared earlier:</p>
