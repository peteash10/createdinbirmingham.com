<blockquote><p>a virtual mall focused on helping small businesses and artisans take their offline business online</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s been put together by a team at the <a href="http://oxygenaccelerator.com/" title="Oxygen Accelerator">Oxygen Accelerator</a> tech startup programme at Birmingham Science Park.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just gone live, giving people the option to set up their own online shops. I know there are a few big plans in the works and this is just stage one but, for starters, the option for shoppers to search across all stores (which I always thought was strangely absent from the likes of <a href="http://bigcartel.com/" title="Big Cartel">Big Cartel</a> and <a href="http://www.shopify.com/" title="Shopify">Shopify</a>) is there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after an online shop then you might want to give this one a look. It&#8217;s free to set up a store, instead there&#8217;s a 10% transaction cost on sales. Because the team&#8217;s local they&#8217;re probably very receptive to feedback for improving the service too.</p>

<blockquote><p>volunteers from the UK tech community as part of the &#8220;Children in Need Tech Challenge&#8221; hosted at The <a title="Oxygen Accelerator" href="http://www.oxygenaccelerator.com/">Oxygen Accelerator</a> in Birmingham.</p>
<p>600 schoolchildren in the Birmingham area were asked to come up with a game idea and the characters that they saw being part of it. The best entries were shortlisted and asked to come to Oxygen and face a &#8220;Dragons Den&#8221; panel of game developers, designers and local businessmen</p></blockquote>
<p>It was built in a 48-hour flurry over the weekend. Here&#8217;s the <a title="Whack-a-cake - About" href="http://whackacake.com/about.html">full list of people who made it happen</a>.</p>
