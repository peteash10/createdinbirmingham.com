				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gor blimey, it&#8217;s another one of those really long weekends. Here are some things you might want to consider filling all that time with.</p>
<p>For starters, I haven&#8217;t got a flyer for this one but <a href="http://www.lizzyparks.com/">Lizzy Parks</a> is playing in the Symphony Hall foyers today (Friday) from 5.30pm to 7pm and it&#8217;s free. <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/rush-hour-blues-lizzy-parkes">Info on the THSH website</a>. Or indeed <a href=" http://www.birminghamjazz.co.uk/wordpress/?cat=268">the Birmingham Jazz website</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day (in fact from 12pm to 7pm) head over to <a href="http://pst-club.co.uk/2011/04/19/the-for-king-wedding-street-party-outside-pst-29th-april-12-midday-till-7pm/">Lombard Street in Digbeth for</a> PST&#8217;s street party. This here flyer says there&#8217;s going to be food, live art and heavy bass. And face painting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/street-party.jpg" rel="lightbox[9731]"><img src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/street-party.jpg" alt="PST street party" title="street party" width="383" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9734" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/street-party.jpg 383w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/street-party-156x300.jpg 156w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></a></p>

<a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/wedlock.jpg" rel="lightbox[9731]"><img src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/wedlock.jpg" alt="wedlock" title="wedlock" width="500" height="707" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9733" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/wedlock.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/wedlock-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks back I <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/12/22/got-a-minute-to-fill-out-a-survey/">put up a survey</a> because I was interested in seeing which websites or online services people use to find out what’s going on around Birmingham.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had 100 submissions, which seems like a good place to draw things to a close and have a look at the results:</p>
<p><strong>Listings/what&#8217;s on</strong></p>
<p>70 &#8211; Venues&#8217; own websites<br />
49 &#8211; CiBmail<br />
30 &#8211; Birmingham City Council &#8211; What&#8217;s On<br />
29 &#8211; Live Brum<br />
18 &#8211; What&#8217;s on in Brum<br />
17 &#8211; Ticketmaster<br />
14 &#8211; Visit Birmingham<br />
10 &#8211; Scene Central<br />
6 &#8211; Birmingham Alive<br />
4 &#8211; Birmingham Gig Guide<br />
4 &#8211; What&#8217;s On Midlands (online)</p>
<p>Suggestions left in the &#8216;other&#8217; box included The Ticketsellers, Last.fm, Songkick, Ents24, Brum Notes, finditinbirmingham.com, More Canals Than Venice, The Wire and Upcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Arts/culture news</strong></p>
<p>80 &#8211; Created in Birmingham<br />
76 &#8211; Blogs/social network updates from individual artists/organisations<br />
34 &#8211; Digbeth is Good<br />
32 &#8211; BiNS<br />
32 &#8211; More Canals Than Venice<br />
24 &#8211; Birmingham Post/Mail (online)<br />
20 &#8211; Arts Council England Arts News<br />
15 &#8211; Audiences Central</p>
<p>Others included Ryan&#8217;s Gig Guide, An Craic, We Are Eastside and Area Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Who filled out the survey?</strong></p>
<p>We had a roughly 50:50 male/female split, a wide spread of ages (with a slight skew to 18-25 and 26-35) and pretty much everyone has a B postcode, with a smattering of WV and DY&#8217;s too.</p>
<p><strong>Any conclusions?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing really concrete, but it was interesting. I&#8217;ve got an idea of the level of web traffic of some of the sites listed, so I know that the results certainly doesn&#8217;t indicate which are the most popular websites around the city. However, you could say that this shows which other websites overlap with CiB&#8217;s readership.</p>
<p>If anything, I was expecting the Post &amp; Mail to come up a bit higher. Nice to see Live Brum up there.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out and/or forward on the survey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing the round-up of where else to go for arts/culture/etc info. This is an easy one, because <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">Who&#8217;s Laughing Now</a> is pretty much the best/only place I know of for Birmingham-based comedy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now.jpg" rel="lightbox[3931]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3933" title="Who’s Laughing Now" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now.jpg" alt="Who’s Laughing Now" width="500" height="197" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now-300x118.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Listings come from <a href="http://www.livebrum.co.uk/genres/comedy">Live Brum</a> (although they&#8217;re not coming through quite right at the mo, so check Live Brum itself), news comes from <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/">Chortle</a> and they add their own news, previews and reviews. Their <a href="http://twitter.com/whoslaughingnow">Twitter account</a> puts out a weekly top tip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glee.co.uk/index.php?id_page=183&amp;id_club=1">The Glee Club</a> and <a href="http://bookings.jongleurs.com/jongleurs/venues/21/birmingham">Jongleurs</a> are the main venues around town so it&#8217;s worth browsing their listings too, just in case.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still getting up to speed on what&#8217;s happening around town but thought it&#8217;d make sense to go through some of the main sources of arts/culture/ents info out there. Next up: listings websites. There are loads of em and theoretically they should all have the same information on them. Here&#8217;s the ones I know of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://allbrum.co.uk/">All Brum</a> / <a href="http://artbrum.co.uk/">Art Brum</a> / <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/">Live Brum</a> &#8211; there&#8217;s a whole family of these sites now, all feeding into All Brum which tends to be my first port of call if I&#8217;m at a loose end. Stuffed with nice features too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birmingham-alive.com/">Birmingham Alive</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/whatson.bcc">Birmingham City Council</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamgigguide.com/">Birmingham Gig Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamlistings.co.uk/">Birmingham Listings</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.myvillage.com/birmingham/whats-on">MyVillage</a> &#8211; they&#8217;ve gone for a social network flavour but</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scenecentral.co.uk/">Scene Central</a> &#8211; Audiences Central&#8217;s offering with a West Mids-wide scope</li>
<li><a href="http://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/Birmingham/">Skiddle</a> &#8211; as you might expect from Skiddle there&#8217;s a greater number of club nights than on many other sites but there&#8217;s a fair amount of other stuff too</li>
<li><a href="http://whatson.visitbirmingham.com/">Visit Birmingham</a> &#8211; the official tourist information visitor website</li>
<li><a href="http://www.woib.co.uk/">What&#8217;s On In Brum</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB &#8211; The following aren&#8217;t really listings, just good sources of info:</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://russl.wordpress.com/">Russ L</a>&#8216;s monthly &#8216;Lots Of Things To See And Do In The West Midlands&#8217; series which tends to feature theatre, gigs, the main festivals and boxing/mixed martial arts (NB &#8211; don&#8217;t try and submit stuff to him or you&#8217;ll find yourself excluded).  The 7 Inch Cinema newsletter is always stuffed with interesting local events too &#8211; sign up for that on the <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/">7 Inch website</a>.</p>
<p>Have I missed anything decent from that list? What do you tend to use?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" rel="lightbox[2035]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2043" title="artsfest1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="187" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> is a big sprawling beast of a festival and a difficult one to wrangle from a listings perspective. A few people have chipped in with their take on how things could/should be presented but for me, while all of them help in some way, none of them really hit the nail on the head.Â  Still here are they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every event has been manfully wrangled into the <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/events/search?search=artsfest">Live Brum database</a></li>
<li>Jon Bounds has <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/5572128/Artsfest-Programme">scanned the programme and put it online</a></li>
<li>He&#8217;s also put together <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100285685412338791851.00045623f1c67b8d55eb9&amp;ll=52.478298,-1.904819&amp;spn=0.006051,0.018883&amp;z=16">a map showing what&#8217;s happening where</a> (but not when)</li>
<li>Matthew Somerville from <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/">Dracos.co.uk</a> has put together a <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/play/artsfest/">searchable list of events listed by time</a>, not location</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the small team running Artsfest wouldn&#8217;t have the budget or reach to put something like the above together, so it&#8217;s great to see the local community take it upon themselves.</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s of any use to anyone, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m planning to do.Â  Or at least what I think looks interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Friday evening</strong></p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s fun takes place against the backdrop of <a href="http://www.lightnight.co.uk/">Light Night</a>, of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stan&#8217;s Cafe are opening the doors of AE Harris Factory (110 Northwood Street, B3 1SZ) for Of All The People In All The World (6.30-9pm)</li>
<li>From 7pm (not sure until when) there are two interesting things happening at the Council House.Â  Definitely worth seeing are <a href="http://www.willard-wigan.com/">Willard Wigan&#8217;s astounding micro sculptures</a>.Â  Sonia Bhamra will be Painting With Light in another room which might be worth a look if you&#8217;re there</li>
<li>Gallery 10 at BM&amp;AG has <a href="http://www.comfortism.co.uk/">Comfortism</a> who, I think, mixes up poetry, theatre and stand-up with the odd bit of audience participation.Â  Could be interesting</li>
<li>At 8pm there&#8217;s a parade from the Pavillions to Centenary Square</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/late-night-light-night">Town Hall present Late Night Light Night</a> and they&#8217;ll be open from 8pm for perfomances by Soweto Kinch, The Sub Ensemble, Manga and Maylight (who I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s the tricky one.Â  There&#8217;s loads happening so the best thing might just be to go for a wander around the city centre and see what you stumble across.Â  That said&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nic Gaunt&#8217;s exhibition &#8216;<a href="http://www.newrotunda.co.uk/about%20the%20project.html">The Rotunda: 21 Stories</a>&#8216; will be at The Pavillions all day</li>
<li>From 3.30pm to 4.30pm there&#8217;s Raw Magic which is &#8220;a visual installation and promenade performance built into a maze of tents, for audiences to explore and choose which direction they would like to take&#8221;.Â  Some of the people here were involved in the very popular B1 Labyrinths from this year&#8217;s Fierce Festival</li>
<li>From 8pm to 10pm BRB, CBSO and Birmingham Opera Company share the Centenary Square stage for one of the weekend&#8217;s big items.Â  Plus there&#8217;ll be fireworks.</li>
<li>After that it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/">Project X Presents</a> for me.Â  It&#8217;s not Artsfest-related but it does look pretty exciting, so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I&#8217;m functioning at 12pm then I&#8217;ll want some &#8216;beautiful heartwarming acoustic/electronica music&#8217;.Â  At the Custard Factory, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/elliotjack">Elliot Jack</a> will be playingjust that.</li>
<li>After that I might wander into the Custard Factory Theatre for some short flicks courtesy of Shortcuts</li>
<li>From 7pm <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/08/19/needle-thread-theatre-presents-between-the-lines/">Needle &amp; Thread Theatre are doing the rather charming-looking &#8216;Between The Lines&#8217;</a> &#8211; walking theatre around the Central Library.Â  This is on on Saturday too (call 07530 939 380 to book a free place)</li>
<li>It&#8217;s Kerrangfest in Centenary Square from 12pm with The Mexicolas, The Metros, Envy &amp; Other Sins and The Levellers later in the evening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, whether I actually get round a fraction of all of that is another question.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.culdesaconline.com/">Cul-de-Sac</a> has the sort of news, album reviews, gig reviews and so on that you&#8217;d expect from this sort of music site but with a West Mids slant.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m dead pleased to see this spring up, partly because I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll take a weight off CiB.Â  When I get emails with local bands&#8217; MySpace pages or gigs/nights/etc listings I&#8217;m wary that if I mention one I&#8217;d have no reason (other than my own bias) for not mentioning them all.Â  There are a bunch of sites doing that job better than I ever could.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/">Live Brum</a>, <a href="http://www.woib.co.uk/">What&#8217;s On In Brum</a>, <a href="http://www.birminghamgigguide.com/">Birmingham Gig Guide</a>, <a href="http://www.birmingham-alive.com/">Birmingham Alive</a> and others for listings. <a href="http://www.brumlive.com/">Birmingham Live</a> and <a href="http://thehearingaid.blogspot.com/">The Hearing Aid</a> take care of reviews and again, there&#8217;s a few others doing that too.Â  However, there was a big <a href="http://www.culdesaconline.com/">Cul-de-Sac</a>-shaped hole for news and reviews.Â  I&#8217;ve high hopes for this one.</p>
<p>What might be even more interesting would be for a few of the above-mentioned to find a way of sharing their content somehow.Â  Just a thought&#8230;</p>
