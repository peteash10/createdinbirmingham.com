<p>8 workshops exploring body image and sexuality will culminate with a group exhibition at Ort. in Balsall Heath from the 19th September until the 2nd October. The project is only possible because of a successful crowdfunding campaign to cover the costs of the workshops. Although the target has just been reached there are still two days left to support the project at the <a href="http://wefund.com/project/bodies...-in-motion/p44393/">Wefund page</a>.</p>

<p>All of the artworks will be displayed in a public exhibition between 1-16 October and the deadline for submissions is 5pm, 27 September 2011, so there&#8217;s still time to get etching. For details on how to get involved, contact <a href="mailto:learning@macarts.co.uk">learning@macarts.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>This fresh faced quarterly magazine has been put together by a small team who have created, produced and printed <a href="http://issuu.com/george.eko/docs/texturelabbsamplebook">LABB magazine</a> in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Aiming to harvest and showcase emerging talent in art, fashion and photography, LABB allows readers to explore something new as oppose to the same churned out work seen in fellow coffee table mags.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fashion, it&#8217;s like a science, you always want to push the limits,  find something new, but its always based on the existing. Not everyone  who works in a lab wears a white jacket&#8230; WELCOME TO OUR LABB!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://issuu.com/george.eko/docs/texturelabbsamplebook">Issue 1, Volume 2</a> is currently available, with Volume 3 on the way for September. In the meantime they&#8217;ve also got a blog, <a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/">LABB Loves</a>, which is great if, like me, you like flicking through dozens of highly stylised fashion photography.</p>
