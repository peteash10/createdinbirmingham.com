				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just past the halfway point&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/27/cib-shop-new-beginnings/">Pete kicked off discussions</a> about how to follow on from the CiB Shop, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/27/the-little-chill/">The Little Chill looked like fun</a> and involved pretty much every promoter in town and <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/26/supersonic-2010/">Supersonic&#8217;s line-up</a> started coming together.</p>
<p>There was a lot of kerfuffle around <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/26/filming-turbulence/">the filming of Turbulence</a>, with lots of people getting involved in that too, and people seemed to be printing <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/25/poster-type-flyers/">big flyers for things</a>. I didn&#8217;t make it to <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/17/taste-of-birmingham-2010/">Taste of Birmingham</a> but people tell me it was pretty good. We also flagged up the work of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/12/sweaty-eskimo/">Sweaty Eskimo</a>.</p>
<p>BARG announced some <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/24/barg-taste-the-game/">fun and games at the Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/23/haji-noor-deen-at-the-hubb/">Haji Noor Deen visited The Hubb</a>, the Cut Out Shop folks made <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/06/the-diy-times/">The DIY Times</a> and I did a bit of a write-up from the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/08/the-first-be-festival/">BE Festival</a>. New Art Gallery Walsall <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/18/photos-at-nagw/">hosted the Taylor Wessing Photography Prize</a> for a while and the entirely excellent-looking <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/16/six-summer-saturdays/">Six Summer Saturdays</a> started.</p>
<p>There was news of cuts from the new government and I tried to wrap my head around the mess that was being made of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/20/about-these-leps/">sorting out a LEP</a> for Birmingham/West Midlands. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/13/the-flyeringpostering-issue/">The flyering/postering issue</a> got another run out too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/15/maybe-next-time/">Birmingham didn&#8217;t get the nod for City of Culture 2013</a>. Ah well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer brought with it <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/13/birmingham-degree-shows/">degree show time of year</a> and also <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/its-the-first-be-festival-soon/">the first Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> (which I&#8217;m pleased to see will be back again this year). Listings started coming out for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/the-hmv-institute/">the HMV Institute</a> too.</p>
<p>The days were getting longer, which was probably just as well for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/19/rhubarb-collision-hungry/">Rhubarb Rhubarb, who seemed to doing loads</a>. Birmingham presented its <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/city-of-culture-finger-crossing-time/">final bid for the City of Culture</a> and we crossed our fingers. Temper <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/30/cut-from-a-different-cloth/">filled the streets with fashion icons</a>. We looked at the trailer for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/24/soulboy-trailer/">Soulboy</a> and discovered <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/reuben-colley-fine-arts-blog/">the blog for Reuben Colley Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/arts-funding-cuts-in-the-west-midlands/">Arts Council announced a 0.5% cut</a> in funding to RFO&#8217;s. Boo. We found <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/15/synth-eastwood-in-birmingham/">some familiar faces</a> in Synth Eastwood&#8217;s video tomfoolery from the Flatpack Festival. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/14/treasured-a-secret-journey/">Treasured</a> at the MAC looked good.</p>
<p>Bright Space started looking for people to get involved in <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/11/platform-2/">Platform</a> and I asked &#8216;<a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/08/does-birmingham-future-interest-you/">Does Birmingham Future interest you?</a>&#8216; and got a fairly resounding &#8216;Um, who?&#8217;. Theatre folk came together and spoke easy, the newly opened Zellig hosted the Bass Festival&#8217;s <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/04/speakeasy/">Fight The Power exhibition</a> and there was talk of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/verbalise-and-visualise/">verbalising and visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>Creative Republic launched <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/creative-republics-invisible-city-project/">Invisible City</a> and Marketing Birmingham released <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/a-couple-of-videos/">a new promotional video for the city</a> that featured a host of creative talent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re taking a bit of a break here but CiB will return in the new year. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll be posting a few &#8216;year in review&#8217; things to remind you that 2010 was alright really, and that all the talk of (and worrying over) money over recent months shouldn&#8217;t detract from some great art, work and artworks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just to show how 2010 looked on Created in Birmingham, we published 649 blog posts and attracted 578 comments, garnering 222,264 pageviews from 81,937 unique (like snowflakes) visitors. There was also 1 shop that took £45,000, with most of that money going to the artists themselves.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months we&#8217;ve also had <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/cib-supporters/">40 CiB supporters</a> and a handful of advertisers &#8211; a big thank you goes out to them for helping us to keep the site going.</p>
<p>These were the 10 most popular posts published this year:</p>

</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m not really one for doing &#8216;best of&#8217;s but (off the top of my head) it was good to see <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">the MAC</a> reopening, I liked the Steve McCurry retrospective at BMAG and <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/458/the_body_electric/">Len Lye at Ikon</a> (which is still on), <a href="http://www.befestival.org/">Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> was fun and I enjoyed a load of things at <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>.</p>
<p>Odd but great moments included &#8216;sleeping&#8217; on stage during <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>&#8216;s <em>Tuning Out with Radio Z</em> (which <a href="http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/2010/05/last-night-i-couldnt-sleep/">I&#8217;ve written about here</a>) and, of course, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/bullring-shop/">That Shop</a>.</p>
<p>There was plenty more besides and far too many things I wish I&#8217;d seen but didn&#8217;t. I suppose I&#8217;ll just have to try to see more next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="BE Festival by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/4772279393/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4772279393_1a3076a2dc.jpg" alt="BE Festival" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>On Saturday night I took a couple of (out of town) friends to AE Harris for the <a href="http://www.befestival.org/">Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a>. We turned up a bit late so only managed to catch the last piece &#8211; one which would&#8217;ve been a fantastic spoof on art student theatre if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact they were taking themselves seriously.</p>
<p>Serves us right for turning up late &#8211; I&#8217;m told some of the earlier suff was ace. The night wasn&#8217;t over though, with a reasonably-priced bar, music from the <a href="http://www.tgcollective.com/">TG Collective</a> (in the rather dark pic above), some last-night awards handed to the companies that had performed, the <a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/148249-be-festival-singers">results of the singing workshop</a> from earlier in the day (audio below) and, <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1028">as reported on Stan&#8217;s Cafe&#8217;s blog</a>, music and dancing till dawn.</p>
<p><object id="iefix1" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="129" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="data" value="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" /><param name="scale" value="noscale" /><param name="salign" value="lt" /><param name="bgColor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers.mp3&amp;mp3Author=chrisunitt&amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers&amp;mp3Title=BE+Festival+singers&amp;mp3Time=11.31pm+03+Jul+2010" /><param name="src" value="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" /><embed id="iefix1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="129" src="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" flashvars="mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers.mp3&amp;mp3Author=chrisunitt&amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F148249-be-festival-singers&amp;mp3Title=BE+Festival+singers&amp;mp3Time=11.31pm+03+Jul+2010" wmode="window" allowscriptaccess="always" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" salign="lt" scale="noscale" data="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf"></embed></object></p>
<p>Despite some worries about ticket sales in the weeks beforehand, the last couple of nights of the festival were pretty much sold out and the various theatre companies who had come to the city seemed to have enjoyed themselves, with much talk of returning next year.</p>
<p>There was a fantastic atmosphere and my friends went away impressed with the sort of thing that Birmingham gets up to, so well done all who were involved. As <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1028&amp;cpage=1#comment-870">Graeme rightly comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was worth being there for the sense of gathering alone</p></blockquote>
<p>One last thing &#8211; it was a little odd to see AE Harris decked out as a &#8216;proper&#8217; theatre but it scrubs up rather well. I&#8217;ve seen it used for all sorts of things since it opened &#8211; 24HR Scalextric, launch parties, a Christmas party, filled with rice by Stan&#8217;s Cafe and filled with detritus (including upturned cars) by Kindle Theatre. It fills a very important and individual gap in a city that&#8217;s not blessed with mid-size venues, so it&#8217;s encouraging to hear that discussions are ongoing to keep the place open past the initial lease.</p>

<blockquote><p>Applications are now open to companies across Europe for the first ever <a href="http://www.befestival.org/">BE Festival</a>, which will take place over four days: 30 June &#8211; 3 July 2010</p></blockquote>
<p>The venue will be A E Harris where, <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=890">as Stan&#8217;s Cafe point out</a>, a fundraiser will be held for this event:</p>
<blockquote><p>Temple Theatre are going to be performing their production <a href="http://www.templetheatre.co.uk/">Out Of Chaos</a> @ A E Harris on  21st May. Doors open 19.30 show at 20.00. Tickets £10. To reserve  tickets email info@befestival.org with your name and the number of  tickets you require</p></blockquote>
<p>The show&#8217;s had some great reviews and it all sounds worthwhile considering.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if anyone&#8217;s looking to sell tickets online for an event, <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> does the job pretty well.</p>
