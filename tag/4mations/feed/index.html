&#8220;ACE dance and musicâ€™s classes for all ages resume in September. All are based at their studio on Floodgate Street.&#8221; Nicky points to the details</li>
<li><a href="http://donaldsavagesays.blogspot.com/2008/08/final-announcement-before-disappearing.html">Donald Savage Says&#8230;.: Final announcement before disappearing on 28th August 2008</a><br />
&#8220;Blog formally disappeared on the 28th August 2008.<br />
Birmingham in the United Kingdom remains changed.&#8221;<br />
Class.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/2008/08/28/welcome-support-from-the-arts-council/">Project X Presents &#8211; Welcome support from the Arts Council</a><br />
Some good news for the PXP people and a nice fillip just a couple of weeks before their next event (at BUSK on Saturday 13 September &#8211; tickets are a just a tenner)</li>
<li><a href="http://russl.wordpress.com/2008/08/28/lots-of-things-to-see-and-do-in-the-west-midlands-september-2008/">Lots Of Things To See And Do In The West Midlands</a><br />
After declaring August to be a bit pants (my words, not his) Russ L rounds up a lot more fun activities for September. He likes Travis though, so take it with a pinch of salt (joke!)</li>
<li><a href="http://thejazzbreakfast.wordpress.com/">thejazzbreakfast</a><br />
Peter Bacon has just overhauled his blog and would like to say hi &#8211; he writes about jazz for the Birmingham Post and is also an arts administrator and saxomophone player</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cominrecords.com/2008/08/28/moseley-folk-festival-special-offer/">Commercially Inviable Records &#8211; Moseley Folk Festival, Special Offer</a><br />
&#8220;To celebrate the festival we are offering both the Friends of the Stars and James Summerfield albums for a special, one-off festival price of Â£12 (including postage).&#8221; Or a tenner at the Polar Bear stall at the festival itself. James plays on Friday, FOTS play on Sunday</li>
<li><a href="http://www.4mations.tv/">Welcome to 4mations</a><br />
The city&#8217;s animation talent might be interested in this &#8211; it&#8217;s in beta (ie a pre-release version) at the moment but you can upload your films (and games) already</li>
<li><a href="http://largecow.com/gallery/the-beano/the-owl-and-the-pussycat-1">Hunt Emersonâ€™s â€œThe Owl and The Pussycatâ€ online</a><br />
Hunt Emerson&#8217;s adaptation of Edward Lear&#8217;s nonsense poem was featured in the Beano and can now be seen online. Apparently it&#8217;s success means further adaptations are in the pipeline <em>(<a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=4242">via D&#8217;Log</a>)</em></li>
