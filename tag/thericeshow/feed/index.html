				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t want to come across like <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VF_uOgyBK1c">an advert for football on Sky</a>, but there are three things happening in Birmingham this weekend and they&#8217;re all (to coin a phrase) kind of a big deal:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/">Project X Presents</a> (Sat 13th, 8pm to 3am) &#8211; this promises to be very cool indeed.Â  Comedy, music, visuals, weird buzzing boxes&#8230; A new city centre venue to explore, sensible drink prices and only a tenner.Â  Check out the website for pics of how it&#8217;s all been coming together over the past week.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/ofallthepeople/">Of All The People In All The World</a> (today, 6.30pm until 5 Oct) &#8211; Stan&#8217;s Cafe bring their big, crazy and thought-provoking show to Birmingham.Â  &#8220;112 tonnes of rice â€“ 6.7 billion grains â€“ one for everyone on the planet&#8221;.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> (all weekend) &#8211; the UK&#8217;s biggest arts festival.Â  If you can&#8217;t find anything to enjoy then&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t know.Â  It&#8217;s not as if people haven&#8217;t been trying to <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/09/10/finding-your-way-around-artsfest/">help you find the good stuff</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;ll probably be some collective memory shenanigans coming up so if you go to any of these things and take photos/video/blog about them then chuck a link here and it&#8217;ll go into the pot.</p>
<p>Oh, and tag anything Stan&#8217;s Cafe-related with &#8216;thericeshow&#8217; for it to feed into the clever little website for <a href="http://www.thericeshow.com/">The Rice Show</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" rel="lightbox[2035]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2043" title="artsfest1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="187" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> is a big sprawling beast of a festival and a difficult one to wrangle from a listings perspective. A few people have chipped in with their take on how things could/should be presented but for me, while all of them help in some way, none of them really hit the nail on the head.Â  Still here are they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every event has been manfully wrangled into the <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/events/search?search=artsfest">Live Brum database</a></li>
<li>Jon Bounds has <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/5572128/Artsfest-Programme">scanned the programme and put it online</a></li>
<li>He&#8217;s also put together <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100285685412338791851.00045623f1c67b8d55eb9&amp;ll=52.478298,-1.904819&amp;spn=0.006051,0.018883&amp;z=16">a map showing what&#8217;s happening where</a> (but not when)</li>
<li>Matthew Somerville from <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/">Dracos.co.uk</a> has put together a <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/play/artsfest/">searchable list of events listed by time</a>, not location</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the small team running Artsfest wouldn&#8217;t have the budget or reach to put something like the above together, so it&#8217;s great to see the local community take it upon themselves.</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s of any use to anyone, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m planning to do.Â  Or at least what I think looks interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Friday evening</strong></p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s fun takes place against the backdrop of <a href="http://www.lightnight.co.uk/">Light Night</a>, of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stan&#8217;s Cafe are opening the doors of AE Harris Factory (110 Northwood Street, B3 1SZ) for Of All The People In All The World (6.30-9pm)</li>
<li>From 7pm (not sure until when) there are two interesting things happening at the Council House.Â  Definitely worth seeing are <a href="http://www.willard-wigan.com/">Willard Wigan&#8217;s astounding micro sculptures</a>.Â  Sonia Bhamra will be Painting With Light in another room which might be worth a look if you&#8217;re there</li>
<li>Gallery 10 at BM&amp;AG has <a href="http://www.comfortism.co.uk/">Comfortism</a> who, I think, mixes up poetry, theatre and stand-up with the odd bit of audience participation.Â  Could be interesting</li>
<li>At 8pm there&#8217;s a parade from the Pavillions to Centenary Square</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/late-night-light-night">Town Hall present Late Night Light Night</a> and they&#8217;ll be open from 8pm for perfomances by Soweto Kinch, The Sub Ensemble, Manga and Maylight (who I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s the tricky one.Â  There&#8217;s loads happening so the best thing might just be to go for a wander around the city centre and see what you stumble across.Â  That said&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nic Gaunt&#8217;s exhibition &#8216;<a href="http://www.newrotunda.co.uk/about%20the%20project.html">The Rotunda: 21 Stories</a>&#8216; will be at The Pavillions all day</li>
<li>From 3.30pm to 4.30pm there&#8217;s Raw Magic which is &#8220;a visual installation and promenade performance built into a maze of tents, for audiences to explore and choose which direction they would like to take&#8221;.Â  Some of the people here were involved in the very popular B1 Labyrinths from this year&#8217;s Fierce Festival</li>
<li>From 8pm to 10pm BRB, CBSO and Birmingham Opera Company share the Centenary Square stage for one of the weekend&#8217;s big items.Â  Plus there&#8217;ll be fireworks.</li>
<li>After that it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/">Project X Presents</a> for me.Â  It&#8217;s not Artsfest-related but it does look pretty exciting, so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I&#8217;m functioning at 12pm then I&#8217;ll want some &#8216;beautiful heartwarming acoustic/electronica music&#8217;.Â  At the Custard Factory, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/elliotjack">Elliot Jack</a> will be playingjust that.</li>
<li>After that I might wander into the Custard Factory Theatre for some short flicks courtesy of Shortcuts</li>
<li>From 7pm <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/08/19/needle-thread-theatre-presents-between-the-lines/">Needle &amp; Thread Theatre are doing the rather charming-looking &#8216;Between The Lines&#8217;</a> &#8211; walking theatre around the Central Library.Â  This is on on Saturday too (call 07530 939 380 to book a free place)</li>
<li>It&#8217;s Kerrangfest in Centenary Square from 12pm with The Mexicolas, The Metros, Envy &amp; Other Sins and The Levellers later in the evening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, whether I actually get round a fraction of all of that is another question.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.regenwm.org/events/event_details.asp?eid=519">CELR: Brownfield canvas: how the Arts can support the regeneration of brownfield land</a><br />
Happening on 25 Sept at The Tower Ballroom and presented by the Arts Council &#8220;The event will also include a focus on the Arts as a creative medium, which can help transform a space, enriching a community or an area through its processes&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.richbatsford.com/?p=298">Rich Batsford &#8211; Project X Presents: Digital Dystopia Sat Sept 13</a><br />
&#8220;You are cordially invited to the one and only performance of our unique Project X Presents event Digital Dystopia&#8221;. Just a week to go, there are some snippets of info about what&#8217;s going on here. I&#8217;m quite excited about this</li>
