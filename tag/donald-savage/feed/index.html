<li><a href="http://www.thericeshow.com/">The Rice Show</a><br />
A kind of automatic collective memory/aggregator thing for the upcoming Stan&#8217;s Cafe production &#8216;Of All The People In All The World&#8217;. Anything tagged thericeshow should show up on there</li>
<li><a href="http://www.regenwm.org/events/event_details.asp?eid=519">CELR: Brownfield canvas: how the Arts can support the regeneration of brownfield land</a><br />
Happening on 25 Sept at The Tower Ballroom and presented by the Arts Council &#8220;The event will also include a focus on the Arts as a creative medium, which can help transform a space, enriching a community or an area through its processes&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.richbatsford.com/?p=298">Rich Batsford &#8211; Project X Presents: Digital Dystopia Sat Sept 13</a><br />
&#8220;You are cordially invited to the one and only performance of our unique Project X Presents event Digital Dystopia&#8221;. Just a week to go, there are some snippets of info about what&#8217;s going on here. I&#8217;m quite excited about this</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamwords.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=881">Birmingham Words &#8211; Storytelling in Birmingham</a><br />

&#8220;ACE dance and musicâ€™s classes for all ages resume in September. All are based at their studio on Floodgate Street.&#8221; Nicky points to the details</li>
<li><a href="http://donaldsavagesays.blogspot.com/2008/08/final-announcement-before-disappearing.html">Donald Savage Says&#8230;.: Final announcement before disappearing on 28th August 2008</a><br />
&#8220;Blog formally disappeared on the 28th August 2008.<br />
Birmingham in the United Kingdom remains changed.&#8221;<br />
Class.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/2008/08/28/welcome-support-from-the-arts-council/">Project X Presents &#8211; Welcome support from the Arts Council</a><br />
Some good news for the PXP people and a nice fillip just a couple of weeks before their next event (at BUSK on Saturday 13 September &#8211; tickets are a just a tenner)</li>
<li><a href="http://russl.wordpress.com/2008/08/28/lots-of-things-to-see-and-do-in-the-west-midlands-september-2008/">Lots Of Things To See And Do In The West Midlands</a><br />
After declaring August to be a bit pants (my words, not his) Russ L rounds up a lot more fun activities for September. He likes Travis though, so take it with a pinch of salt (joke!)</li>
<li><a href="http://thejazzbreakfast.wordpress.com/">thejazzbreakfast</a><br />
Peter Bacon has just overhauled his blog and would like to say hi &#8211; he writes about jazz for the Birmingham Post and is also an arts administrator and saxomophone player</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cominrecords.com/2008/08/28/moseley-folk-festival-special-offer/">Commercially Inviable Records &#8211; Moseley Folk Festival, Special Offer</a><br />
&#8220;To celebrate the festival we are offering both the Friends of the Stars and James Summerfield albums for a special, one-off festival price of Â£12 (including postage).&#8221; Or a tenner at the Polar Bear stall at the festival itself. James plays on Friday, FOTS play on Sunday</li>
<li><a href="http://www.4mations.tv/">Welcome to 4mations</a><br />
The city&#8217;s animation talent might be interested in this &#8211; it&#8217;s in beta (ie a pre-release version) at the moment but you can upload your films (and games) already</li>
<li><a href="http://largecow.com/gallery/the-beano/the-owl-and-the-pussycat-1">Hunt Emersonâ€™s â€œThe Owl and The Pussycatâ€ online</a><br />
Hunt Emerson&#8217;s adaptation of Edward Lear&#8217;s nonsense poem was featured in the Beano and can now be seen online. Apparently it&#8217;s success means further adaptations are in the pipeline <em>(<a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=4242">via D&#8217;Log</a>)</em></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a bit slow in reporting on this and have just noticed that it&#8217;s now almost finished.Â  If it ever started, of course (Wayne at the Metro <a href="http://westmidlandsblog.metro.co.uk/2008/08/seeing-isnt-bel.html">has doubts</a>).</p>
<p>Donald Savage is an &#8216;American international cultural producer and curator&#8217;.Â  Since 9 August he has been:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bringing you the very best in artistic excellence from around the globe to the heart of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. I specialise in discrete and perhaps less obvious presentations of artistsâ€™ work that I have the pleasure of including in this current exhibition programme</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s an introduction to the artists involved on <a href="http://donaldsavagesays.blogspot.com/2008/07/invisible-art-show-helps-birmingham-in.html">Donald Savage&#8217;s blog</a> and here&#8217;s the flyer:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/donaldsavage.jpg" rel="lightbox[1934]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1965" title="donaldsavage" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/donaldsavage.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="448" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/donaldsavage.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/donaldsavage-300x268.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Reports on the artists&#8217; work have started appearing on the blog.Â  So far <a href="http://donaldsavagesays.blogspot.com/2008/08/habit-of-being-al-tennyson-usa.html">Al Tennyson (USA)</a>, Rebecca West and <a href="http://donaldsavagesays.blogspot.com/2008/08/affordable-luxury-atsuko-haru-japan.html">Atsuko Haru (Japan)</a>, and <a href="http://donaldsavagesays.blogspot.com/2008/08/rebecca-wests-psychic-impression-of.html">Rebecca West (Canada)</a> have featured.</p>
<p>Things will be wrapped up on Thursday 21 August, although it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that will involve.Â  If anything.</p>
<p>At this point you may have the impression that I have no idea what&#8217;s going on here and you&#8217;d be right.Â  It looks fun though.</p>
