				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A message that went up on <a href="http://www.taktak.net">Tak</a>&#8216;s website last month confirming the news that had been doing the rounds for a little while:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of July 2010 &#8211; exactly six years from the day they opened &#8211; we closed the doors at TAK! Towers to explore new ideas &amp; ventures. It&#8217;s been fun, thanks for having us!</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Tak had been responsible for the <a href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/">Home of Metal</a> website, the branding for <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/">British Dance Edition</a> and had picked up a run of awards for their work on <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/">BMAG&#8217;s Pre-Raphaelite website</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve just heard (<a href="http://twitter.com/animationforum/status/20700382410">via Dave Allen</a>) that <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/">Script</a>, the West Mids agency for dramatic writers, are shutting up shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with great regret and reluctance that the Board of Script has taken the decision to dissolve the company as of the end of August 2010.</p>
<p>The loss of RFO status in March 2008 has had a serious impact on the company&#8217;s resources, and the reliance on ever-decreasing pots of project funding has made its future existence unsustainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/home_news.html">Script&#8217;s August newsletter</a> for further info and to see a slew of opportunities for writers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.historycultures.bham.ac.uk/events/dayschools/index.shtml">University of Birmingham&#8217;s School of History and Cultures</a> do a series of day schools.</p>
<blockquote><p>These courses are designed for anyone interested in the subject and no  background knowledge is assumed.  The focal points are on the  archaeology, history, culture and heritage of the West Midlands region,  Britain and beyond</p></blockquote>
<p>There have been <a href="http://www.historycultures.bham.ac.uk/events/eveningclasses/index.shtml">evening classes</a> too, but the current schedule of those has just finished. In fact there&#8217;s only a few of the day schools left:</p>
<ul>
<li>26 June &#8211; Pre-Raphaelite Art and Literature: Connections and Influences</li>
<li>3 July &#8211; Arts and Crafts in the Midlands from Birmingham to the Cotswolds</li>
<li>10 July &#8211; Medieval Churches in the Midlands</li>
</ul>
<p>Discovered via a passing mention on the website of <a href="http://www.sallyhoban.com/">Sally Hoban</a> who&#8217;s a writer, consultant and lecturer on design,                          antiques and art.</p>
