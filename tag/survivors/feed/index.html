				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been a spate of Birmingham sightings on primetime TV recently. Partly this is due to some efforts by <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/">Screen WM</a> (and others, I imagine) to get some more filming done up here, partly it&#8217;s due to the fact that there are some darn fine restaurants in the city these days.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/hustle.jpg" rel="lightbox[4726]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4734" title="hustle" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/hustle.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="91" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/hustle.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/hustle-300x54.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The new series of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007gf9k">Hustle</a> started on Monday and featured a bunch of local sights from around the <a href="http://colmorebusinessdistrict.co.uk/">Colmore BID</a> &#8211; Metro, Hotel du Vin and One Victoria Square (<a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/dailybulletin/news2/2010/01/05/hustle-and-survivors-bring-bbc-to-birmingham-65233-25534836/">according to the BPo</a>).</p>
<p>Next week the same area will be sporting a slightly different look for the new series of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00q3gk5">Survivors</a>.</p>
<p>Over on Channel 4, <a href="http://www.lasangroup.com/restaurant/">Lasan</a> is doing rather well having reached the final of Gordon Ramsey&#8217;s <a href="http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/f-word/series-5/index.html">The F Word</a>. Unfortunately <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=thefword">the consensus on Twitter</a> last night seemed to be that their chef was a bit of a pillock. Incidentally, Warwick Uni have a Lasan cookbook featuring healthy versions of various South Asian dishes which you can <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/warwickbooks/spice_for_life">download for free</a>.</p>
<p>The latest episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00pts4r/Hustle_Series_6_Episode_1/">Hustle is on the iPlayer here</a> for the next few days and is on every Tues for the next little while. Survivors is on BBC 1 on 12 January and the big final of the F Word is on Channel 4 on Thurs at 9pm.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Katie/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-5.jpg" alt="" />Following a recent announcement that BBC&#8217;s drama &#8216;Survivors&#8217; will relocate to the West Midlands, <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk" target="_blank">Screen WM</a> has announced today that  they are investing  in the next series of <a href="http://www.kudosproductions.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kudos Film and Television</a>’s major international TV drama, Hustle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3674" title="hustle" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hustle.jpg" alt="hustle" width="600" height="116" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hustle.jpg 600w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hustle-300x58.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The investment means that Hustle will relocate to Birmingham, and the city will provide a new backdrop for the drama which is broadcast across the world. This is a major coup for the city and forms part of a wider strategy by Screen WM to secure and create a more sustainable screen media sector in the West Midlands. The series will bring an estimated £1.2 million into the regional economy and will provide jobs for local crew.</p>
<p>The Hustle team are due to move to Birmingham and will be living in the city for the duration of the filming. In addition to financial investment, Screen WM have played a significant role in attracting the new series of Hustle to the West Midlands, working closely with Film Birmingham, providing locations and crew support. The producers were attracted to the West Midlands on the basis of the region’s diverse locations, excellent facilities and experienced crew.</p>
<p>Simon Crawford Collins, Joint Managing Director of Kudos said: “We are hugely excited about Hustle’s move to Birmingham.  It’s a transformed city whose cool new locations have rarely been used for TV dramas and we will hope it will become a hub for Kudos’s output for many years to come.”</p>
