				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next PILOT Night, co-piloted by Kindle Theatre at AE Harris, Birmingham will be on Thursday 1 April 2010. Here&#8217;s some copy/pasted info. For more knowledge, and to apply, go to <a href="http://www.pilotnights.co.uk">www.pilotnights.co.uk</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pilot is a platform for testing new theatre work from the West Midlands and beyond. Deadline for submissions Monday 1st March, 12pm</p>
<p>RELEASE THE BEAST</p>
<p>Had an idea laying dormant for a while that you almost daren&#8217;t wake up? Not sure if it&#8217;s mad or genius?<br />
Kindle invite performers/practitioners/fools to submit ideas for performance which frighten them.  Whether in form, content or style it must push you beyond your comfort zone into unknown territory.</p>
<p>Challenge yourself in a lively, supportive atmosphere and get honest feedback from peers and audience.  All fools will be applauded.</p>
<p>AE Harris is an industrial warehouse in Birmingham&#8217;s Jewelry Quarter. It&#8217;s big, blank and open to you, with four huge spaces and lots of corners, nooks and crannies to test your idea in. Site-specific ideas are most welcome.</p>
<p>We can offer you a small bursary, documentation of your performance, and rehearsal space in the venue from Monday 29th March.</p>
<p>Kindle will also be hosting an unusual meal for all the artists involved on the Wednesday night, in the venue.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other news, on 6 March you should definitely go to Warwick Arts Centre for <a href="http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/season/bite-size">The Bite Size Festival 2010</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>a whirlwind tour of the region&#8217;s theatre, offering you the one-off opportunity to sample a range of great work in one place on the same day.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s lineup includes <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk">Stans Cafe</a>, <a href="http://www.pentabus.co.uk/">Pentabus</a>, <a href="http://www.foursighttheatre.co.uk/">Foursight</a>, <a href="http://www.kindletheatre.co.uk">Kindle</a>, <a href="http://www.janepackman.freeuk.com/">Jane Packman Productions</a>, <a href="http://www.spannertheatre.co.uk/pages/home.html">Spanner</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/newmacho">New Macho</a>, Needle and Thread and Vanessa Oakes. PLUS the first opportunity to see two shows we’ve commissioned especially with Warwick Arts Centre and mac following the First Bite Festival back in November: Caroline Horton’s <em>You’re Not Like The Other Girls Chrissy</em> and <a href="http://www.theuntiedartists.co.uk/Site/Home.html">Untied Artists</a>’ <em>Al Bowlly’s Croon Manifesto</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grab a day ticket and wallow in some entertainingness. Kindle Theatre will be doing 30 mins of <em><a href="http://kindletheatre.co.uk/2009/10/10/eat-your-heart-out-2/">Eat Your Heart Out</a></em>, which I saw last year and thought was really very good indeed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a lot of theatre to talk about at the moment. Must be the time of year or something. This looks like being a bit more than theatre though &#8211; &#8220;a performance that invites the audience to literally eat the story&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://kindletheatre.co.uk/?p=124">Kindle Theatre&#8217;s <em>&#8216;Eat Your Heart Out&#8217;</em></a> will be at the AE Harris Building from 29 October to 8 November. I&#8217;m not quite sure how to explain this so I&#8217;m going to do the sensible thing &#8211; quote the promo blurb, post the flyer and suggest you <a href="http://bit.ly/iaXqS">grab a ticket</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last remaining corner of the human world, three cooks are summoned to create a celebratory meal using only the carcass of their once great kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8230;the set will be an apocalyptic junkyard made from Birmingham’s own rubbish and installed by designers Tony Appleby and Claire Wearn. Multimedia design company <a href="http://filmcafe.co.uk/" target="_blank">filmcafe</a> will be creating photographs and lighting inspired by the work of Caravaggio, whilst regional composer-musician Phill Ward will work with Kindle performer-musicians to create a score that reinvents the decadence of the Baroque era. The company are also working food designers <a href="http://www.blanchandshock.com/" target="_blank">Blanch &amp; Shock</a>, to design what promises to be an unforgettable menu</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/eat-your-heart-out.jpg" rel="lightbox[4005]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4006" title="eat-your-heart-out" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/eat-your-heart-out.jpg" alt="eat-your-heart-out" width="450" height="639" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/eat-your-heart-out.jpg 450w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/eat-your-heart-out-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><br />
Tickets aren&#8217;t all that cheap but <a href="http://stanscafe.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-to-see-and-do.html">James at Stan&#8217;s Cafe reckons</a> it looks like being good value for money:</p>
<blockquote><p>At first glance the casual observer may think the tickets quite dear but there is an insane amount of stuff in the plus, live music and food plus they&#8217;ve been working manically hard for ages on it, so essentially it&#8217;s three nights out in one go and thus good value I would imagine</p></blockquote>
