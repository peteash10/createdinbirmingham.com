				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, <a href="http://www.thebigdebatebirmingham.co.uk/">can the Midlands&#8217; creative industries revolutionise the UK economy?</a></p>
<p>Well, I wasn&#8217;t at The Big Debate on Monday, so I can&#8217;t tell you what the answer was. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/bigdebate/2009/11/03/big-debate-s-ideas-for-supporting-creative-economy-65233-25075916/">a list of ideas</a> that came out of the event, although if that&#8217;s anything to go by the answer was &#8220;no, we need to sort ourselves out before telling the rest of the country what to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>That may not be an accurate summary though.</p>
<p>If you want to find out for yourselves, the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/bigdebate/2009/11/02/live-webchat-and-video-streaming-from-the-big-debate-65233-25071486/">live stream and blog</a> are both archived on the Birmingham Post website. I hear Charles Leadbetter was good.</p>
<p>Personally, I was impressed by the series of blog posts that preceded the main event:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/comment/birmingham-columnists/agenda/2009/11/02/birmingham-post-editor-marc-reeves-on-how-creative-industries-in-the-west-midlands-can-advance-65233-25067748/">The Post&#8217;s own Marc Reeves</a> wrote an excellent piece criticising the &#8220;erratic approach to creating ‘quarters’ across the city&#8221; and addressing access to finance saying &#8220;Put simply, many in the creative sector need to grow up, put on a suit, and get to know how finance works&#8221;. Well worth a read</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/09/local-work-for-local-people.html">Fullrange&#8217;s Lee Kemp</a> was persuasive on  regional work projects being reserved for regional (in his view a very bad idea)</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/10/measuring-the-impact-its-a-bea.html">Screen WM&#8217;s Jason Hall</a> talked about how to prove the impact of creative stuff. Answer &#8211; join a network. If there isn&#8217;t one for you then start one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, since the event, <a href="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2009/11/03/the-big-debate-taking-people-out-of-their-comfort-zones/">Paul Bradshaw</a> has countered those who complained of too much talk and too little action. <a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/11/the-big-debate---the-big-myths.html">Dave Harte has done likewise</a> while attempting to lay a few other myths to rest. <a href="http://rebeccasykes.co.uk/safe-haven-for-pirates/">Rebecca Sykes</a> and <a href="http://andrewbrightwell.com/blog/birmingham/ten-things-birmingham-can-do-to-welcome-the-pirates/">Andrew Brightwell</a> have put their thoughts down too.</p>
<p>If anyone was there it&#8217;d be good to get your thoughts on the event.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t promote your entire programme, promote small batches of events.  By all means have a list of everything that&#8217;s going on (I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s very big and impressive) but don&#8217;t go wave it in peoples&#8217; faces too much.</p>
<p>Not my idea but that of <a href="http://www.thebigdebatebirmingham.co.uk/anthony_rose.htm">Anthony Rose</a> from the BBC.  His point, made at <a href="http://www.thebigdebatebirmingham.co.uk/">The Big Debate</a> yesterday, is that too much choice is stifling.  Applying it to festivals (of which there are <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/05/11/birmingham-summer-festivals-round-up/">many happening/coming up</a> in Birmingham) he said that he loves the idea of them but, faced with an unending list of things to do, he ends up doing nothing.</p>
<p>He suggests festivals break their listings down, perhaps :</p>
<ul>
<li>Just the highlights</li>
<li>Just the free events</li>
<li>Just the weekend events</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on, you get the idea.</p>
<p>He said if you picked out four highlights for him he&#8217;d probably go along.  Give him a list of 50 to pick from and he&#8217;ll just sit at home.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;d probably agree.  Anyone else?  Anyone think it&#8217;s a daft idea?  I&#8217;d be especially interested to hear from anyone involved in festival organisation.</p>
