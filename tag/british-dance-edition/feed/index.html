				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A message that went up on <a href="http://www.taktak.net">Tak</a>&#8216;s website last month confirming the news that had been doing the rounds for a little while:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of July 2010 &#8211; exactly six years from the day they opened &#8211; we closed the doors at TAK! Towers to explore new ideas &amp; ventures. It&#8217;s been fun, thanks for having us!</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Tak had been responsible for the <a href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/">Home of Metal</a> website, the branding for <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/">British Dance Edition</a> and had picked up a run of awards for their work on <a href="http://www.preraphaelites.org/">BMAG&#8217;s Pre-Raphaelite website</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve just heard (<a href="http://twitter.com/animationforum/status/20700382410">via Dave Allen</a>) that <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/">Script</a>, the West Mids agency for dramatic writers, are shutting up shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with great regret and reluctance that the Board of Script has taken the decision to dissolve the company as of the end of August 2010.</p>
<p>The loss of RFO status in March 2008 has had a serious impact on the company&#8217;s resources, and the reliance on ever-decreasing pots of project funding has made its future existence unsustainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/home_news.html">Script&#8217;s August newsletter</a> for further info and to see a slew of opportunities for writers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition.jpg" rel="lightbox[5003]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5004" title="British Dance Edition" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="248" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/British-Dance-Edition-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>During my first stint on Created in Birmingham I had a nagging feeling that there was loads of good dance stuff going on but it was all happening under my radar. I&#8217;m pretty much on top of it these days, partly for the reasons given in the disclaimer at the bottom of this post but mainly because there&#8217;s so much dance stuff happening around the city this year.</p>
<p>Anyway, from tomorrow until Sunday, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk">British Dance Edition</a> &#8211; a biennial showcase of the British dance scene &#8211; is in Birmingham. It&#8217;s a big deal, with <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/venues/">loads of venues</a> hosting performances, events, presentations and debates. It&#8217;s a national showcase, not a local one, but there&#8217;s a fair bit of local interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rosie Kay previewing her new piece, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/the-body-is-the-frontline">5 SOLDIERS &#8211; The Body Is The Frontline</a></li>
<li>DanceXchange showing some of their work on <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/repeat-performance-the-5-man-show">The 5 Man Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/listen">Listen</a> by Ace Dance &amp; Music</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/funny-bones">Funny Bones</a>, from dX and Two&#8217;s Company Management</li>
<li>Receptions hosted by <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/international-dance-festival-birmingham-reception">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>, <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/reception-birmingham-royal-ballet-and-elmhurst-sch">Birmingham Royal Ballet</a> and <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/reception-people-dancing">People Dancing</a>.</li>
<li>Walking tours of the city for delegates (<a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/digbeth-walking-tour-with-ian-jelf">Digbeth</a> and the <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/birmingham-city-walking-tour-3-jewellery-quarter">Jewellery Quarter</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more too. Most of it&#8217;s for paying delegates only but there are <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/public-events/">some good public events too</a>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer &#8211; I&#8217;m working on/at British Dance Edition (incl <a href="http://www.bde2010.co.uk/event/multi-platform-dance-the-future-of-dance-online">one of the debates</a>) and <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>. <a href="http://westmidlandsdance.com/">WestMidlandsDance.com</a> is one of my websites too.</p>
