<blockquote><p>Buchalter will be expanding on his current body of work exploring how we  flow through and interact with public spaces and what happens when  aspects of our environment are disrupted</p></blockquote>
<p>Not revealing what the full nature of this &#8216;intervention&#8217; will be, he&#8217;ll be targeting the pedestrian traffic en route to the   local derby between Birmingham City FC and West Bromwich Albion, with vouchers for free beer at a local pub. A quick flick through of his <a href="http://www.eitanbuchalter.com/">past projects</a> and he seems to do a lot of standing&#8230; Perhaps that&#8217;s something to look out for?</p>
<p>&#8216;Veer&#8217; will also be broadcast live online at <a href="http://www.thisistomorrow.info/default.aspx?webPageId=1">This is Tomorrow</a>, from 11.30am.</p>
<p>As an In Association With … artist at VIVID and a  Fierce Festival 2011  artist, he&#8217;ll also be featuring at this years <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/?page_id=915">Fierce Festival</a>, with a  talk, workshop and intervention.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Call for Participants: The slightest movement, Fierce &amp; Quarantine</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.qtine.com">Quarantine</a>, in partnership with <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a>, are hosting a project entitled <a href="http://www.qtine.com/future/">The Slightest Movement</a>, bringing together groups of strangers to create a temporary community which openly debates difference, exploring tolerance and &#8216;otherness&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The task is repeated every day for a week.  Each day the event is  re-invented according to what happened the day before.  A small group  grows into a large one, gathering more and more strangers into a  temporary &#8211; perhaps uneasy &#8211; community.</p></blockquote>
<p>The slightest movement will take place 20-25 September in West Bromwich, and are inviting a core group of 15 people, both artists and non-artists, irrespective of background and experience to join this project. If you fancy getting involved, apply using the application via their website <a href="http://www.qtine.com/">www.qtine.com</a> by 3 September.</p>
<p><strong>Autumn Exhibition Opportunity &#8211; Call for Designer Makers, Brilliantly Birmingham</strong></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.brilliantlybirmingham.com/">Brilliantly Birmingham</a> festival is taking place  27 November 2010 – 9 January 2011, and is set to visit a variety of venues across the city, including the Flux exhibition of contemporary jewellery design at the <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A dynamic and ambitious exhibition of  new and emerging designer makers will promote challenging and diverse  new work, create a marketplace and contribute to the city as a visitor  attraction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flux is currently open to submissions from emerging designer makers based in the UK, who are no more than five years out of graduation. There&#8217;s no exhibition fee, but submissions have a £20 admin fee.</p>
<p>Application packs can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.brilliantlybirmingham.com/">www.brilliantlybirmingham.com</a> and must be submitted by 3 September.</p>
