Not quite sure what the deal is with this one. They&#8217;ve got a DIY print studio and are looking for people to submit designs for them to use on T-shirts and so on. A physical shop is apparently coming in summer 09, in the meantime they&#8217;re up online with a website (coming soon) and this blog</li>

&#8220;The Town Hall and Symphony Hall website have launched a new online booking system for their events&#8230;  Also, as an introductory offer, you can take advantage of free postage on all bookings up to November 30th&#8221;</li>

The next meeting about this is on Tues 14 October at 6.30pm in the Library cafe, Birmingham city centre.  Seek out the Birmingham Flickr group for how the discussion about this is going; this is a link to the draft vision they&#8217;ve prepared</li>

The Flip Animation folk put out a reminder for the Animation Forum WM&#8217;s Grads on Walls event on Monday (good to see people talking up other people&#8217;s events &#8211; a very smart thing to do, I&#8217;d say)</li>

&#8220;The 500 people who have made it through this year&#8217;s Style Search will be whittled down to just ten this weekend at a special party at Gatecrasher&#8221;.  Why am I linking to this? Um&#8230; just spreading the joy I guess</li>

Is it me or does the text in the link make no sense. Basically, Fazeley Studios has been chosen as the venue for the 2008 Plus Design Festival. Shame on me for not spotting that they had a blog though, and thanks to Nicky at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2008/10/links-for-october-10th-which-includes-a-slight-rant/">Digbeth is Good</a> for pointing it out</li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=28040414727&amp;ref=nf">Facebook group &#8211; mid*point</a><br />
&#8220;mid*point is the network for independent theatre companies in the West Midlands&#8221; There doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any activity on the website for over a year but they&#8217;ve just started a Facebook group so something must be going on under the hood</li>

<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youplusus.net/plus_international_design_expo_fest08.html">Plus International Design Festival</a> is &#8216;Hybrid&#8217;.Â  It takes place on 5 to 8 November 2008 and, as the folks at <a href="http://fusedmagazine.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/plus-design-expo-want-you/">Fused have picked up on</a>, a call has been put out for submissions:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Festival is now seeking exhibitors, speakers and demonstrators to work to the theme of Hybrid, which has been chosen as the focus of this yearâ€™s event as it not only aptly describes Britain &#8211; which is a unique country that has developed in an exceptional way &#8211; but it also expresses the current state of graphic communications.</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t go to this last year and for no good reason.Â  I looked at it, thought it seemed really interesting and then felt daft for not bothering.Â  There&#8217;s a lesson there.Â  Anyway, enough mutterings, if you&#8217;re a designer then you probably want a link for some <a href="http://www.youplusus.net/plus_international_design_expo_submissions.html">more info on those submissions</a>.</p>
