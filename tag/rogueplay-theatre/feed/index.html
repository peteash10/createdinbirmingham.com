				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rogueplay.co.uk/">RoguePlay</a> took over the theatre space in the <a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/">Custard Factory</a> at the end of last year but are on the move already. <a href="http://rogueplay.blogspot.com/2010/05/rogueplay-are-relocating.html">This from their blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>trying to run a theatre which aims to embrace and nurture young talent  has been made almost impossible when clashing with raves and road  closures. We appreciate the long standing reputation of the Custard Factory as  one of Birmingham&#8217;s biggest party places but the knock on effect this  has had on our customers and facilities has become too much</p></blockquote>
<p>So off they travel.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re looking for interesting places to use and have looked at:</p>
<blockquote><p>Railway Stations as well as arches, Churches, Post Offices, discussed  Shop Fronts, pubs and even an old car forecourt and will be re-opening  the Mixing Bowl Theatre in one of these unique performance spaces</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re still looking too, so if you know of an interesting, disused site (or if you&#8217;ve got a good space) then <a href="http://rogueplay.blogspot.com/2010/05/rogueplay-are-relocating.html">contact them via their blog</a>.</p>
