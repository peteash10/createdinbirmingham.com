<p>Showing at the <a title="The Electric Cinema" href="https://www.theelectric.co.uk/" target="_blank">Electric Cinema</a> until 15th May (this Thursday) Locke is set almost entirely inside the car of its main character Ivan Locke (played by Tom Hardy) as he travels from Birmingham to London.  It&#8217;s the perfect film to see at the Electric as you chuckle whilst he drives out of town, towards spaghetti junction and past Star City&#8230;</p>
<p>Written and directed by Steven Knight, the creator of Peaky Blinders, it&#8217;s not your typical blockbuster, but an engaging and cleverly thought through piece of cinema which draws you in.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are a few trailers that have made it onto my &#8216;to blog&#8217; list recently.</p>
<p>First up, a trailer for the upcoming performance of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Td2DvHFhmU">the Mozart Requiem by Notorious</a>:</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="305" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4Td2DvHFhmU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://clareedwards.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/notorious-does-the-mozart-requiem/">Clare Edwards has blogged some info about this</a>.</p>
<p>Next is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&#038;v=STzFEvhauRM">the trailer for The Last Projectionist</a>:</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="335" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/STzFEvhauRM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;d heard of <a href="http://www.thelastprojectionist.co.uk/" title="The Last Projectionist">The Last Projectionist</a> before but somehow hadn&#8217;t twigged what it was about:</p>
<blockquote><p>The story centres on The Electric in Birmingham, the oldest working cinema in Britian. From its silent beginnings in 1909; to a news and cartoon cinema during WWII; a porn cinema in the 70s &#038; 80s; then saved from demolition and restored to its art deco glory in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="http://vimeo.com/12208756" title="King Adora documentary trailer">the trailer for a soon-to-be-released documentary about King Adora</a>:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/12208756?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="601" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>I met Ben Lewis (who was also involved in The Last Projectionist) from <a href="http://www.siwelproductions.co.uk/" title="Siwel Productions">Siwel Productions</a> last week and he emailed me some more info about this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d wanted to make a documentary for a while and although my close friend was in the band I&#8217;d never really explored what that experience was like for him. We got talking and I&#8217;d decided that I&#8217;d like to produce a film about not only King Adora but what its like being in a band, any band, the music business at that time ( pre social media boom) , and nature of creativity etc </p>
<p>Self funded and calling in favours from friends in the industry the project grew and various characters that had featured in the bands timeline began to show interest. Steve Lamacq gave a great interview as did John Cornfield, the producer of their first album.</p>
<p>We managed to get into the jug of ale pub in Moseley ( now being converted ) as it very much was a part of the band and many other bands history. </p>
<p>The band reformed in 2010 for two shows at the Hare and Hounds and the Garage in Islington. It was great to interview the fans, some from way back and new fans that had found the band via you tube and facebook etc</p>
<p>I was always conscious that I didn&#8217;t want to adhere to a narrative in which band get signed, band break up, band reform etc </p>
<p>The film runs parallel narratives that explore the relationships witihin the band, what there up to now and how the &#8220;ride&#8221; effected them.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>7 Inch Cinema&#8217;s family-friendly <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/project/travelling-picture-show/">Travelling Picture Show</a> has been chugging around the region since July and will be pitching up for its <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/event/travelling-picture-show-grand-finale/">gala finale at the Electric Cinema</a> on 25 October from 6-7.30pm.</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be cartoons from around the world, a pair of comedy classics with live piano accompaniment and the premiere of <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/project/travelling-picture-show/the-magic-box">The Magic Box</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/cv7.jpg" rel="lightbox[3927]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3928" title="cv7" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/cv7.jpg" alt="cv7" width="450" height="299" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/cv7.jpg 450w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/cv7-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>The Magic Box has been created by children at workshops held across the West Midlands &#8211; it&#8217;s a kind of animated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_%28game%29">Consequences</a>.</p>
<p>One for the kids then, but I&#8217;m willing to bet there&#8217;ll be plenty for the grown-ups too. Grab tix from the <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/booking/">Electric&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
