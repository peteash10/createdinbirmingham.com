				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of hard work, late nights and pushing their creativity to the limits it is time for this years graduates to present the 2014 BA Degree Shows. Over the next few days some of the West Midlands finest universities will be exhibiting a wide range of work from fashion and textiles, fine art, photography and graphic design (and much more!).</p>

<p>The University of Wolverhampton opened its doors last weekend to friends, family and the general public to celebrate the work of their students. This has been a tradition in their building since 1969 with over 8,000 students taking part to date. The <a title="Degree Show" href="http://www2.wlv.ac.uk/degreeshow14/" target="_blank">degree show</a> is on until Saturday 14th June.</p>

<p>The Birmingham Institute of Art and Design Graduate shows are also on until Saturday 14th June with dates and activities varying across location and subject areas, please check the website to <a title="Birmingham" href="http://www.bcu.ac.uk/biad/about/graduate-shows-2014" target="_blank">find out more</a>. With the main subject areas spanning art, visual communication, fashion &amp; textiles, 3D design, architecture and jewellery &#8211; there is a lot to go and see.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17716" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Staffordshire.jpg" alt="Staffordshire" width="610" height="133" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Staffordshire.jpg 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Staffordshire-300x65.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>Staffordshire University&#8217;s annual Art and Design show opens Friday 13th June and will be open to everyone until Saturday 21st June.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer brought with it <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/13/birmingham-degree-shows/">degree show time of year</a> and also <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/its-the-first-be-festival-soon/">the first Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> (which I&#8217;m pleased to see will be back again this year). Listings started coming out for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/the-hmv-institute/">the HMV Institute</a> too.</p>
<p>The days were getting longer, which was probably just as well for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/19/rhubarb-collision-hungry/">Rhubarb Rhubarb, who seemed to doing loads</a>. Birmingham presented its <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/city-of-culture-finger-crossing-time/">final bid for the City of Culture</a> and we crossed our fingers. Temper <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/30/cut-from-a-different-cloth/">filled the streets with fashion icons</a>. We looked at the trailer for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/24/soulboy-trailer/">Soulboy</a> and discovered <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/reuben-colley-fine-arts-blog/">the blog for Reuben Colley Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/arts-funding-cuts-in-the-west-midlands/">Arts Council announced a 0.5% cut</a> in funding to RFO&#8217;s. Boo. We found <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/15/synth-eastwood-in-birmingham/">some familiar faces</a> in Synth Eastwood&#8217;s video tomfoolery from the Flatpack Festival. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/14/treasured-a-secret-journey/">Treasured</a> at the MAC looked good.</p>
<p>Bright Space started looking for people to get involved in <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/11/platform-2/">Platform</a> and I asked &#8216;<a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/08/does-birmingham-future-interest-you/">Does Birmingham Future interest you?</a>&#8216; and got a fairly resounding &#8216;Um, who?&#8217;. Theatre folk came together and spoke easy, the newly opened Zellig hosted the Bass Festival&#8217;s <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/04/speakeasy/">Fight The Power exhibition</a> and there was talk of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/verbalise-and-visualise/">verbalising and visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>Creative Republic launched <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/creative-republics-invisible-city-project/">Invisible City</a> and Marketing Birmingham released <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/a-couple-of-videos/">a new promotional video for the city</a> that featured a host of creative talent.</p>
