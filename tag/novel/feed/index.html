				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iain Grant, writer and editor of <a title="PPP" href="http://pigeonparkpress.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pigeon Park Press</a>, is calling for expression of interest from writers for their new project Ten to One and you have until March 31st to get in touch with a sample of your work and a brief writing bio.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14683" alt="Ten To One" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53-248x300.png" width="248" height="300" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53-248x300.png 248w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53.png 648w" sizes="(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px" /></p>
<p>So, what is Ten to One?</p>
<blockquote><p>Ten To One is a collaborative writing project. Ten writers will work together to produce a novel-length piece of fiction which will then by published by Pigeon Park Press. Each writer will handle one of ten central characters and write the chapters focussing on that character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The most exciting, and unique, feature of this project is that after each writer has written one chapter one of the characters will be kicked out of the story. The character that is kicked out is decided by both a panel of judges, this will be three individuals who are known and respected in the writing world and will change as the project moves on, and a public vote. At the end of the novel there will be one character left from the initial ten; Ten To One.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans for what genre Ten To One will be, making it a blank page for the differing styles and ideas of each writer to develop together into one story.</p>
<p>Contact details and further information about this project can be found <a title="PPP" href="http://pigeonparkpress.blogspot.co.uk/p/ten-to-one-collaboratively-written.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Iain is keen for anyone with questions to contact him to discuss the project further. There is also a <a title="TenToOneFacebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/TenToOneNovel" target="_blank">Ten To One</a> Facebook page and <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/TenToOneNovel" target="_blank">Twitter</a> page.</p>
<p>So writers, what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>After being independently published, Birmingham writer <a href="http://charliemachill.weebly.com/index.html">Charlie Hill&#8217;s</a> first novel &#8216;The Space Between Things&#8217; is set in Moseley and looks at the free party people and road  protesters of the early 1990&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Fellow Birmingham author,  Jim Crace, described his writing as &#8216;intelligent and witty&#8217;. Jonathan Coe also gave praise for the book;</p>
<blockquote><p>What I liked very much about the novel  was that it vividly captures a moment in Britain&#8217;s recent past, and  takes us inside a world and a milieu which most readers won&#8217;t have known  before. And of course, as a tragic love story, it packs a considerable  punch.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book will be out 1 October, along with a launch event on 14 October at Waterstones&#8217; Birmingham High  Street branch.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Space Between Things&#8217; can be pre-ordered from Amazon, Waterstones and London Review Bookshop, but you&#8217;d like a head start, Charlie has posted the <a href="http://charliemachill.weebly.com/read-the-first-chapter.html">first chapter online</a>.</p>
