				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/author/kassie-fleet/">Kassie</a> and I spent Saturday going through the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack</a> programme, highlighting what we&#8217;re watching together. With so many films, workshops, events, parties and more to choose from, you really are spoilt for choice. Do have a read of the full <a href="http://issuu.com/flatpack/docs/fp7">programme</a>, especially if you&#8217;re a Flatpack Festival first-timer.</p>
<p><b> &#8216;</b>Flatpack Festival has become one of the cultural highlights of the West Midlands’ calendar year&#8221; said the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/film-news/2013/03/15/flatpack-festival-returns-for-11th-year-of-movie-treats-in-birmingham-65233-32979420/">Birmingham Post last week</a>, in an interview with Flatpack founder Ian Francis.</p>
<div>
<p>There really is something for everyone &#8211; even if you have the strangest of tastes we&#8217;re certain there will be something to tickle your fancy (and there are also a lot of freebies too, so you can&#8217;t even use <i>that</i> excuse.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to be dashing to Arts Forum Selly Oak&#8217;s <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2013/03/13/art-soak-free-arts-festival/">Art SOAK</a> Festival and <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2013/03/15/uob-arts-and-science-festival/">University of Birmingham&#8217;s Arts &amp; Science Festival</a> throughout the Flatpack fortnight as well, so have a look through their list of events too if you&#8217;re planning to be out and about.</p>
<p><span id="more-14658"></span></p>
<p><b>Thursday 21st March 2013</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/safety-last/"><i>Safety Last, </i>8pm,<i> </i>Great Western Arcade.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Safety-Last_01.jpg" rel="lightbox[14658]"><img class="size-full wp-image-14667 aligncenter" alt="Safety-Last_01" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Safety-Last_01.jpg" width="592" height="395" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Safety-Last_01.jpg 592w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Safety-Last_01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The opening night of Flatpack has seen us visiting various churches and concert halls across the city, but this is the first time we’ve launched proceedings in a shopping arcade. Built in 1875 on top of a railway cutting between Snow Hill and Moor Street stations, the spectacular <a href="http://www.greatwesternarcade.co.uk/"><strong>Great Western Arcade</strong></a> will be transforming itself into a cinema for one night only.</p>
<p>Our main feature includes one iconic moment which defined the film and its creator forever. Even if you’ve seen it a hundred times the clock-hanging sequence never fails to startle, but Harold Lloyd’s 1923 romantic comedy <em>Safety Last!</em> offers plenty of other unexpected pleasures and delights. This evening it will be accompanied by pianist <strong>John Sweeney</strong>, and before the lights go down there will be music and refreshments from some of the arcade’s wide variety of independent retailers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Friday 22nd March 2013</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/good-vibrations/"><i>Good Vibrations, </i>9pm, The Electric.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/goodvibe3.jpg" rel="lightbox[14658]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14670" alt="goodvibe3" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/goodvibe3.jpg" width="592" height="395" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/goodvibe3.jpg 592w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/goodvibe3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;70s fashion, oodles of charm and a brilliant soundtrack. What more could you ask for on the first Friday night of this year’s Flatpack? With<em> Good Vibrations</em> directors Lisa Barros D’Sa and Glenn Leyburn tackle the real-life tale of Terri Hooley’s efforts to run a record shop, and subsequently label, in one of the most turbulent areas of Belfast during the Troubles. The result is a marvellous production tinged with just the right amount of nostalgia and comic moments as we follow the difficult path Hooley walked to become a punk pioneer.</p>
<p><b>Saturday 23rd March 2013</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/invisible-architecture/"><i>Invisible Architecture, </i>12pm, meet at Film Bug Hub.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Invisible-architecture.jpg" rel="lightbox[14658]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14673" alt="Invisible-architecture" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Invisible-architecture.jpg" width="592" height="395" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Invisible-architecture.jpg 592w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Invisible-architecture-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Birmingham is a city known for its stark public buildings, planning misadventures and fervent commercial revisionism. Yet it was once a nucleus of joyful architecture, rich ornamentation and inventive urbanism. Surely none of this survives today? On <em>Invisible Architecture</em>, local historian <strong>Ben Waddington</strong> reveals some of the city’s lesser noticed details on our buildings, down back streets and beneath our feet and asks how this magnificent world became lost.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/the-passion-of-joan-of-arc/"><i>The Passion of Joan of Arc, </i>6.30pm, Birmingham Cathedral.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/THE-PASSION-OF-JOAN-OF-ARC_MoC_Press-Still-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[14658]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14674" alt="THE-PASSION-OF-JOAN-OF-ARC_MoC_Press-Still-3" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/THE-PASSION-OF-JOAN-OF-ARC_MoC_Press-Still-3.jpg" width="592" height="395" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/THE-PASSION-OF-JOAN-OF-ARC_MoC_Press-Still-3.jpg 592w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/THE-PASSION-OF-JOAN-OF-ARC_MoC_Press-Still-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;This film was made in the late silent period, just before the dawn of talkies, but it feels like, as Jean Cocteau put it, ‘an historical document from an era in which the cinema didn’t exist.’ Carl Theodor Dreyer takes a familiar story – the country girl who led an army against the English, and ended up on trial for blasphemy – and gives it a piercing, elemental quality. He had a huge, complex set built, based on Rouen Castle, but we see very little of it. Instead the focus is on faces: of the accusers, fierce, suspicious, looming over the camera; and of Joan, played by Marie Falconetti in a soaring performance that seems barely a performance at all.</p>
<p>The director’s approach was so stripped-down that he even preferred the film to be seen without music, but we’re confident that he would have approved of tonight’s accompaniment. Pianist <strong>Paul Shallcross</strong> (last seen in these parts at our Christmas Buster Keaton show) has written a score beautifully attuned to the agony and ecstasy of Dreyer’s vision, and we’re also delighted to be screening a newly spruced-up version of the film produced for the recent Masters of Cinema blu ray release. We hope you’ll agree that this is about as good as cinema gets.</p>
<p><b>Sunday 24th March </b></p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/the-adventures-of-prince-achmed-2/">The Adventures of Prince Achmed</a>, </i>4pm, Bramall Music Building, Flatpack Festival, as part of <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/the-adventures-of-prince-achmed-2/">UoB&#8217;s Arts &amp; Science Festival.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Adventures-of-Prince-Achmed.jpg" rel="lightbox[14658]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14677" alt="The-Adventures-of-Prince-Achmed" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Adventures-of-Prince-Achmed.jpg" width="592" height="395" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Adventures-of-Prince-Achmed.jpg 592w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Adventures-of-Prince-Achmed-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Created by Lotte Reiniger and a small team using scissors and card over the course of three years, <em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed</em> is the oldest surviving animated feature film and still captivates all ages today. Freely adapted from the <em>Tales of 1001 Nights</em>, the quest for a magic lamp takes us across oceans and down into volcanoes, battling with dragons, demons and witches along the way.</p>
<p>This very special event at the University of Birmingham’s new Bramall Music Building will include a live score composed and performed by <strong>Geoff Smith</strong>. A specialist in hammered dulcimers, Smith will be using a range of rare and wonderful instruments including one which he has developed himself, the ‘Fluid Dulcimer.’</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2013/03/13/art-soak-free-arts-festival/">Art SOAK Festival</a> FINALE (free events)</b></p>
<p><i><a href="http://artsforumsellyoak.wordpress.com/art-soak/">Write Down, Speak Up</a>, </i>7pm, <a href="https://twitter.com/TASCOSstirchley">TASCOS</a>, Hazelwell Lane, Stirchley.</p>
<p>Write Down Speak Up is a Birmingham based organisation that uses poetry in all forms to inspire and encourage a wide range of community groups. They have two ‘kick-ass’ poets for your delectation, Deborah Stevenson and Steve Morrison-Burke.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://artsforumsellyoak.wordpress.com/art-soak/">Stirchley Happenings present &#8216;Take Me High&#8217;</a>, </i>8pm, <a href="https://twitter.com/TASCOSstirchley">TASCOS</a>, Hazelwell Lane, Stirchley.</p>
<p>A brilliant Brummie box office favourite starring Cliff Richard. Watch as the icon speeds on a hovercraft under Spaghetti Junction, alongside delivering some memorable tunes. This will be preceded by a short ‘80s film encouraging the middle classes to move to Edgbaston.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack</a> and <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org">Fierce</a> have barely begun, but I&#8217;ve already been taking a sneak peek of a few of the things they&#8217;ve got going on, including <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing Room</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> and a trip over to the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/events/?venue=the-dirty-end">Dirty End</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9494" title="symphony of a missing room" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="385" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg 605w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yesterday morning I headed over to <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a>, for a visit unlike any other. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing</em> Room by Lundahl &amp; Seitl</a>, feeling slightly apprehensive as I was given a pair of wireless headphones, blindfolded and led cautiously around the museum by sounds, voices and a mysterious hand. The whole experience was what I can only describe as dream like, and had me leaving feeling like I&#8217;d been awoken from a deep, disorienting sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far it&#8217;s been receiving plenty of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/symphony%20of%20a%20missing%20room">rave reviews on Twitter</a>, who all seem to be able to put the experience into words so much better than I can. If you want to check it out for yourself, <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room">book via the Fierce website</a>, it&#8217;s definitely one to give a go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last night also saw the launch of both Flatpack and Fierce, at <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>, which has been transformed into The Dirty End. Along with live music from <a href="http://www.juneauprojects.co.uk/">Juneau Projects</a>, they had a few tasty treats and cocktails on offer which will apparently be sticking around for most of the festival.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vintagemobilecinema.co.uk/">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> had it&#8217;s first Flatpack outing this afternoon in Victoria Square, where it gathered quite a few admirers. The 22 seater restored mobile cinema, originally toured British factories from 1967, promoting modern production methods. As one of only seven made, this gem is the last standing after being brought back to life to tour the country once again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9493" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With it&#8217;s cosy little interior, complete with red cinema seats, it feels rather like a mini <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/">Electric</a>. I was also treated to a clip of Buster Keaton&#8217;s silent film <em>Sherlock Junior</em> (1924), which is being screening tomorrow night at the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/an-evening-of-silent-film-and-live-music">Town Hall</a>, accompanied by live organ and piano.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9495" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>If you fancy hopping aboard, the vintage mobile cinema will be at Handsworth Library on Thursday, Birmingham Markets on Saturday, and Cannon Hill Park on Sunday. Take a look at whats on across the weekend over on the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Flatpack site</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and update this post with other Flatpack &amp; Fierce adventures, but in the meantime let us know which events you&#8217;ve made it to and what should be on our &#8216;must see&#8217; lists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/7-inch-cinema.jpg" rel="lightbox[1787]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1788" title="7-inch-cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/7-inch-cinema.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="245" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/7-inch-cinema.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/7-inch-cinema-300x147.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Some great news from the peeps at <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/2008/06/some-exciting-news/">7 Inch Cinema</a> landed on the virtual doormat today.Â  The <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/">Flatpack Festival</a> is the worthy recipient of funding for the next three years, securing it&#8217;s future and allowing the organisers to maybe think a little bigger.</p>
<p>Peter Buckingham from the <a href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/14426">UK Film Council</a> (who are providing the funding) said of Flatpack:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their innovative approach to screening films in churches, warehouses and shopping centres as well as cinemas and gallery spaces is a brilliant idea because it helps to attract new audiences to some great short films, animation and live film events</p></blockquote>
<p>Flatpack 3 will take place in Feb 2009 and will launch &#8220;with a tribute to Birminghamâ€™s pioneering film showman <a href="http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/978229">Waller Jeffs</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deaffest.co.uk/Deaffest/index.html">DeafFest</a> at Wolverhampton Light House have also received funding so well done to them too.</p>
<p>Last word goes to the understandably chuffed Flatpack producers:</p>
<blockquote><p>without going all Oscar-night about it, it wouldnâ€™t have been possible without all the filmmakers, volunteers, artists, promoters, technicians, funders, venues and enthusiastic punters who have chipped in to help us get this far. So thanks a lot, and hereâ€™s to Flatpack III in February 2009 and beyondâ€¦</p></blockquote>
