<p><a href="http://www.wevee.co.uk/">WeVee</a> launched last week, having been shown off all over the place since ArtsFest in Sept last year. It&#8217;s an online tool described on the intro video:</p>
<blockquote><p>WeVee gives you the chance to explore the past, create your very own short mash-ups from archive film clips, edit them to music and share them online</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of the sort of thing, put together by the folks at <a href="http://www.clusta.com">Clusta</a>:</p>
<p><object id="W4b16a2a2883b2b434b5c83eb996b8c35" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="320" height="240" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="data" value="http://widgets.clearspring.com/o/4b16a2a2883b2b43/4b5c83eb996b8c35/4b16a2e791ed61f0/aed1f668/-cpid/97eb2a22ee836602" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="allowNetworking" value="all" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://widgets.clearspring.com/o/4b16a2a2883b2b43/4b5c83eb996b8c35/4b16a2e791ed61f0/aed1f668/-cpid/97eb2a22ee836602" /><embed id="W4b16a2a2883b2b434b5c83eb996b8c35" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="240" src="http://widgets.clearspring.com/o/4b16a2a2883b2b43/4b5c83eb996b8c35/4b16a2e791ed61f0/aed1f668/-cpid/97eb2a22ee836602" allowscriptaccess="always" allownetworking="all" wmode="transparent" data="http://widgets.clearspring.com/o/4b16a2a2883b2b43/4b5c83eb996b8c35/4b16a2e791ed61f0/aed1f668/-cpid/97eb2a22ee836602"></embed></object></p>
<p>I was given access to it a couple of weeks back but, truth be told, I&#8217;ve not had much of a chance to have a poke around it until now. I&#8217;ve just had a play for 10 minutes (it&#8217;s that kind of rigour that CiB is known for) and my initial thoughts are that it&#8217;s good&#8230; as far as it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbs ups</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s beautifully made, reasonably intuitive (for what&#8217;s potentially a very complicated thing) and there are some good clips, including some stuff that&#8217;s apparently never been seen before.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbs downs</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s hard to search through the archive clips (and the video pop-ups when selecting clips got on my wick), I can&#8217;t add my own stuff into the mix, the help section consists of 5 videos when perhaps a little user self-help forum might be nicer and the minimum clip size is too big for what I wanted to do in the vid I was messing about with. Also, you can&#8217;t overlay audio from one clip over that from another (which forces you to make quite jumpy edits). Ah, and I&#8217;ve just spotted that the raw archive footage can&#8217;t be embedded on other sites unless you make  it into a WeVee of its own. Still, let&#8217;s bear in mind the <a href="http://www.wevee.co.uk/about.aspx">about page</a>&#8216;s caveat that  &#8216;this is just the start&#8217;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s odd about WeVee is how it&#8217;s being pitched. As a way to <a href="http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2010/01/22/12524-wevee-brings-archives-into-mashed-up-digital-age">give the public access to the countryâ€™s film and video archive</a> I&#8217;d say it falls well short by being far too locked down:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to use WeVee to edit the clips</li>
<li>I can only use content provided by WeVee &#8211; I can&#8217;t add in my own audio or video</li>
<li>Once I&#8217;ve made something, WeVee keeps hold of it &#8211; I can&#8217;t download it or put it on other video services like YouTube, etc (although you can embed clips elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<p>If it was meant to be an online video library of archive footage it would have been commissioned and designed as one. It&#8217;s not though &#8211; it&#8217;s got other features built in. However, as online video editing tools go, <a href="http://jaycut.com/home">JayCut</a> beats WeVee hands down by letting me edit anything I want. <a href="http://www.kaltura.org/project/Advanced_Timeline_Based_Video_Editor">Kaltura</a>&#8216;s worth a mention too as advanced video editing tools go.</p>
<p>WeVee&#8217;s a tool for educational use really, it&#8217;s just that no-one seems to be saying that. A press release (<a href="www.vivid.org.uk/file/screen_wm_-_dfaf_fund.pdf">PDF</a>)  says that:</p>
<blockquote><p>WeVee is targeted particularly at 14 &#8211; 25  year olds, an audience typically hard-to-reach with a regional history  brief</p></blockquote>
<p>WeVee&#8217;s nice and is a credit to <a href="http://www.clusta.com/">Clusta</a> and <a href="http://www.televisionjunction.co.uk">Television Junction</a> who&#8217;ve built the thing and I imagine it&#8217;ll be a slick kinda educational tool (as well as looking great on the everyone&#8217;s showreels). It just threw me at first by claiming to be different to what it is.</p>
