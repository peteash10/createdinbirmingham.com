<p>The <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/">Birmingham Book Festival</a> starts 1 October with a programme of events that will cover fiction, non-fiction and poetry, as well as a series of <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=categoryevents&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=53">workshops and seminars</a>.Â  The festival ends on 24 October.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a few big names listed in <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=eventlist&amp;Itemid=56">the festival diary</a> &#8211; the ones that stand out for me are Mark Thomas, Will Self and Kate Adie.</p>
<p>For local interest, there&#8217;s the first public performance by Birminghamâ€™s 13th Poet Laureate and 4th Young Poet Laureate and a talk from Catherine O&#8217;Flynn.Â  There&#8217;s quite possibly a lot more local involvement but, semi-literate philistine that I am, I&#8217;m not sure who to give a shout to.</p>
<p>Something I like very much about the festival&#8217;s website is the way they&#8217;ve split up the listings in the left-hand sidebar into different categories, throwing in a wild-card &#8216;<a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=categoryevents&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=61">Something Different</a>&#8216; category too &#8211; that&#8217;s useful for someone like myself who might want to try something out but might not know what to go for.</p>
<p>Speaking of bookishness, the <a href="http://www.lichfieldfestival.org/2008/content/view/59/76/">Lichfield Literature Weekend</a>, a spin-off from the Lichfield Festival, will be held mainly at The George Hotel, Lichfield starting with a literary dinner on 26 September with two guest authors &#8211; Gaynor Arnold (whose &#8216;Girl in a Bue Dress&#8217; from Tindal Street Press is Booker Prize longlisted) and Stephen Robinson.</p>

<ul>
<li>28 May &#8211; Martin Bell will speak about his new book &#8216;The Truth That Sticks&#8217;</li>
<li>12 June &#8211; Prof Robert Knecht, esteemed historian, will introduce his book &#8216;The French Renaissance Court&#8217;</li>
<li>2 July &#8211; Catherine O&#8217;Flynn award-winning local author of &#8216;What Was Lost&#8217; (due to be turned into a film, reports <a href="http://www.thestirrer.co.uk/what-was-lost-the-movie-1405081.html">The Stirrer</a>) will read from the book and sign copies.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;ve got a reading group too, and the staff in there have always been lovely and helpful.  I can&#8217;t help thinking that a little blog to promote and record these events, recommend new books and generally help tie themselves into their community might be a good idea.</p>
<p>If you know of any independent book shops doing interesting events (preferably with some sort of interweb link) then give them a mention in the comments.</p>
