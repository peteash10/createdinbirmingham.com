<p>You never need many excuses to see a film at <a href="https://www.theelectric.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Electric Cinema</a>. This is the oldest working cinema in the UK, it has the comfiest sofas you&#8217;ll ever sit in &#8211; and you can text the bar to bring you drinks and popcorn if you fancy paying for the privilege.</p>
<p>On Friday 25th April they will be screening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o87mygHCsu0" target="_blank">We Are The Freaks</a>, an ode to teen coming-of-age movies, the fall of Margaret Thatcher and mad nights out in 1990s Birmingham. The ensemble cast includes the stars of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0jkv2bRFgQ" target="_blank">This is England</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqkqF--v1tg" target="_blank">Kill List</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm0onseM1Mw" target="_blank">Skins</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XYLVs3le3w" target="_blank">Fresh Meat</a>.</p>
<p>The film premiered at last year&#8217;s Edinburgh Fringe Festival and received some excellent reviews. Birmingham-born director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249210/" target="_blank">Justin Edgar</a> has filled it with energetic and irreverent humour. It does contain many piece-to-camera sequences and references to films of similar genres, but manages not to take itself too seriously.</p>
<p>The film will be followed by an open Q&amp;A session with cast and crew. Click <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/programme.php?film=836" target="_blank">HERE</a> for tickets and more information.</p>

<p><a href="http://ortcafe.co.uk/">Ort</a> is one of those magical unique places outside of the city centre &#8211; in Balsall Heath to be precise, and well worth a venture. I was there on Friday night watching some what can only be described as mesmerising <em>far out</em> jazz.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d post my response to an email I received from someone the other day. The emailer said (and these are a couple of extracts):</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently looking for creative projects to get involved with in the Birmingham area, specifically film or media based projects. I have lots of transferable skills through studying film on my course and I am looking for possible work experience (unpaid) in TV, film or any kind of production, as a runner, film grip and/or any position where the skills I have may come in useful.</p>
<p>My biggest focus is finding opportunities, getting out there and getting involved in anything I can, from possible collaborations to arts events, workshops, anything to keep me busy and anything that allows me to be creative and continues the type of work I was doing on my course.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of anything specific but gave a few starting places. I operate on the assumption that CiB readers know much more than I do, so if anyone can add anything then please do in the comments. My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any specific opportunities at the moment. It&#8217;s a bit of a funny time for that kind of thing at the moment, what with Screen WM (who used to put on events and so on) closing down a few months back and Creative England (the body taking their place) only just getting up and running. In the meantime it might be worth looking at <a href="http://www.bsin.co.uk/">http://www.bsin.co.uk/</a> and seeing what they&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p>Also, have a look at these events, get yourself along and see who you meet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.producersforum.org.uk/">http://www.producersforum.org.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/">http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamsmc.com/">http://www.birminghamsmc.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.helloculture.net/">http://www.helloculture.net/</a> (this is on tomorrow)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Maybe see what courses are happening at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/ ">http://www.macarts.co.uk/</a> or <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/">http://light-house.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p></blockquote>

I don&#8217;t like how this (really quite poorly thought out) survey is being spammed around, but if you want to throw some thoughts towards some research into the potential of local TV in Brum here&#8217;s your chance. It&#8217;s being done by some students (not sure where from) in collaboration with Maverick TV</li>

&#8220;These are our first recordings. They&#8217;re free so share the love and spread the word&#8221;</li>

If you&#8217;re up for a blizzard of policy speak and buzzwords then give this video a try. And good luck to you</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">&#8216;<a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/projects.php?work=69">The Garage Presents&#8230;</a>&#8216; is the first of <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk">VIVID</a>&#8216;s 2011 programme, running throughout February with a series of events in music, film, art and installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The fun kicks off this weekend, with <strong>Video Valentines</strong> on Sat 12 Feb, at 2pm, featuring a free screening of Woody Allen&#8217;s 1977 romcom, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075686/">Annie Hall</a>, alongside a bunch of independent shorts and heart-shaped treats.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The series continues with &#8216;<strong>All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties: The Film + A Short Film by Vincent Moon</strong>&#8216; on Fri 18 Feb. Admission is £2.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This post-punk DIY bricolage uses material generated by  the fans and musicians themselves, on a multitude of formats including  Super8, camcorder and mobile phone material, over the history of the  festival, to capture the uncompromising spirit of a parallel music  universe.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following weekend hosts a screening of Lis Rhodes&#8217; avant-garde installation <em><strong>Light Music</strong> </em>(1975) 25 Feb, from 6.30pm &#8211; 8.30pm, in association with George Saxon and Daniel Simcox</p>
<blockquote><p>Visitors are immersed in the beams of two dueling projectors; as  the film flickers and flashes, Rhodes varies sonic frequency, alters  amplitude, and plays with tone to create a groundbreaking and visceral  cinematic experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally on 26 Feb, <strong>Woof! Woof! William Wegman Weekend </strong>takes place at 2pm.</p>
<blockquote><p>Coming of age in the  1960s, Wegman was an early exponent of conceptual art, well known for  his use of irony, humour and satire. VIVID presents a selection of  Wegman’s video works taken from his 1970s series of cryptic videos which   star his obliging canine partner Man Ray.</p></blockquote>
