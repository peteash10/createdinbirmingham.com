				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I meant to write this up a while back and was reminded by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/polarbearspoken">Polarbear</a> appearing on Radio 3&#8217;s The Verb (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fj2w6">click here to listen again</a>, he&#8217;s on at 11mins) the other night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gone on a bit about how good I think <a href="http://www.myspace.com/polarbearspoken">Polarbear</a> (Steve Camden to his mum) is and a few weeks back I went to see his show &#8216;If I Cover My Nose You Can&#8217;t See Me&#8217; at the REP (who joint-commissioned it with others).Â  In short (and I&#8217;d be prepared to go on at length if you really want) it was brilliant.</p>
<p>After the show everyone was ushered up to the REP&#8217;s mezzanine where musical partner Afrosaxon was manning the decks and graphic designer Goonism was sketching characters from the show. We also had a reading from one of Polarbear&#8217;s inspirations &#8211; a fantastic lady whose name, I&#8217;m ashamed to say, I didn&#8217;t get.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9.jpg" rel="lightbox[2205]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2206" title="polar-bear-6-of-9-by-lee-allen" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-6-of-9-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The photo below might need a bit of explaining.Â  Polarbear works with the West Brom-based <a href="http://www.multistory.org.uk/">Multistory</a> on arts projects with kids, doing all sorts including making these masks (his black eye is make-up from the show, by the way).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9.jpg" rel="lightbox[2205]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2207" title="polar-bear-by-lee-allen" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/polar-bear-2-of-9-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, it was great and if/when he comes back it&#8217;d be well worth checking his show out.Â  For that matter, I reckon spoken word in general is a hugely underrated artform.Â  I know there are a few things about but if you know of/organise anything of that ilk around Birmingham then feel free to hit the comments below with detais of your next event.</p>
