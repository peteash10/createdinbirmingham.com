				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Birmingham Screen Image Network" href="http://www.bsin.co.uk/">Birmingham Screen Image Network (BSIN)</a> is a new group aimed at uniting local people involved with film production. The first meeting is coming up on the 29<sup>th </sup>at Birmingham City University. BSIN describes itself as:</p>
<blockquote><p>A network for practitioners of moving image production.  It is aimed at those who produce video, film and other associated moving image media.</p>
<p>BSIN meets monthly and is intended as a free informal networking opportunity for people to pitch, promote, share ideas, ask questions and mutually benefit from those around the table.</p></blockquote>
<p>Linked to the established <a title="Creative Networks" href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/portal/index.asp">Creative Networks</a> events, this looks like a potentially great scheme to get people collaborating and throwing ideas around. Meetings will take place between 4pm – 6pm on the last Thursday of each month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is always good to see &#8211; following a discussion on the <a href="http://community.filmbirmingham.co.uk/thread/261.aspx">Film Birmingham forum</a>, Rill Marchant and Rebecca Sloan are organising a pub meet-up on Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re interested/involved in any aspect of filmmaking or media come along and join us on Saturday 30th August 2008 from 5:30 pm at Lloyds Bar on Broad Street.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll bring a home made sign or something to put on the table so you can find us when you arrive and I expect we&#8217;ll be there for at least a few hours before (maybe) moving on to another venue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing heavy &#8211; just a chance for people who are into the same thing to meet up and have a chat.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=22007069885">Facebook group</a> for interested peeps to join too.</p>
