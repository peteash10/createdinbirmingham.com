				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have heard, <a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/about-us">Project X</a>&#8216;s last event was due to take place at the Que Club in June but was cancelled because the venue couldn&#8217;t accommodate the collective&#8217;s rather particular needs.Â  As such they were forced to forego funding from a tie-in with the New Generation Arts Festival.</p>
<p>That was the bad news.Â  The good news is that PXP will be back with an event on 13 September 2008 at, of all places, the Birmingham United Services Club.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Frankie Ward&#8217;s <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/07/06/capsule-interview/">interview with the Capsule ladies</a>, PXP scoured more than 30 venues in the city looking for somewhere they could house three stages, 80 participants and a week of on-site preparation.Â  The BUSC apparently fits the bill.</p>
<p>The venue is being refitted and will officially re-open in October &#8211; apparently hosting Edwards-style club events and live bands in an area of town that&#8217;s rapidly becoming the city&#8217;s indie/rock quarter, what with Snobs, Island Bar, the Sunflower Lounge, Subside and soon the Academy/Dome all within pogoing distance.Â  Here&#8217;s a pic of the BUSC pre-refit:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/project-x-presents-4.jpg" rel="lightbox[1893]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1894" title="project-x-presents-4" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/project-x-presents-4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="319" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/project-x-presents-4.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/project-x-presents-4-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The event will</p>
<blockquote><p>explore and create an unforgettable multi-sensory assault based on the theme of Digital Distopia, inspired by 1984, Bladerunner, and the impending threat of I.D cards</p></blockquote>
<p>with at least</p>
<blockquote><p>two rooms, of musicians, performers, dancers, djs, vjs, percussionists, comedians, poets and installations already confirmed and collaborating</p></blockquote>
<p>All of which makes it one for the diary (that&#8217;s 13 September in case you missed it).Â  Tickets will be on sale soonish.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more info and a couple more pics on the <a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/node/167">Project X Presents</a> website.</p>
<p>(Note &#8211; this post was taken down temporarily while the venue was being confirmed)</p>
