<p>There is so much to this outstanding opportunity, so I&#8217;ll let the REP explain it better with some info from the <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/participate/creative-development/rep-foundry/">Foundry Page</a>:</p>

As The REP moves into the next phase in its remarkable history it is looking for emerging directors, writers, theatre makers and companies from across the West Midlands to make the journey with them. Offering a new, yearlong development programme, REP Foundry, will support artists through workshops, making and sharing work and professional mentoring. Information on how to apply is available from the Download Panel on this page.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/participate/creative-development/rep-foundry/">REP Foundry</a> will also offer audiences a unique insight into how new theatre is formed and staged at scratch performance nights.

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>REP Foundry Nights will take place on the last Thursday of the month at 8.00pm on the following dates:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>28 February at The Old Rep Theatre and then at The Edge, Digbeth on 28 March, 25 April, 30 May, 27 June, 25 July </strong></p>
<p>The deadline to be one of the artists contributing to Foundry is <strong>6pm Friday 9th November 2012.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No, it&#8217;s not a very <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/in-rep-at-the-old-rep">original title</a>. Sorry. Still, <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/">Birmingham Rep</a> are continuing their wanderings around the city while building work continues in Centenary Square. Their next show is <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/the-owl-and-the-pussycat">The Owl and The Pussycat</a> at Birmingham Library Theatre.</p>
<p>After that is something extra interesting. They&#8217;ll be setting themselves up at their old home, <a href="http://www.oldreptheatre.org.uk/">The Old Rep Theatre</a>, and the same cast will perform two plays whose runs overlap. The first (and longer running) show is Oscar Wilde&#8217;s <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/the-importance-of-being-earnest">The Importance Of Being Earnest</a> (9 Sept &#8211; 22 Oct) which is joined by a new production of Tom Stoppard&#8217;s Wilde-referencing play <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/travesties">Travesties</a> (17 Sept &#8211; 22 Oct).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Travesties-and-Earnest.png" rel="lightbox[10185]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10186" title="Travesties and Earnest" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Travesties-and-Earnest.png" alt="Travesties and Earnest" width="600" height="299" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Travesties-and-Earnest.png 600w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Travesties-and-Earnest-300x149.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/participate/for-everyone/autumn-extras-2011/">other stuff happening around these two plays too</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As well as our usual <strong>post show discussions</strong> with the cast, there will also be <strong>readings of plays</strong> by Mark Ravenhill, W.S. Gilbert, Neil Bartlett and Carl Miller; <strong>pre-show talks </strong>from experts on the Dada movement, the life of Oscar Wilde and Lenin in theatre and literature; two <strong>curtain raiser events</strong> inspired by the shows and a <strong>youth theatre performance</strong> of an Anthony Horowitz play by The Young REP.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Magical Glow of the Co-op" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3601566610_b94ee026c9_o.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Friday, 05/06/09, 19:00</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten high-backed chairs, some seating elderly people and some seating younger people, spanned the back of the stage area at <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/about/the-door/" target="_blank">The Door</a>, the studio theatre at Birmingham Rep. Above this seating arrangement was a large screen, showing slow panoramics of the Birmingham skyline. In front of them, a gently-lit bed with a man lying down, a wheeled trolley next to him and a fan pointed at him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A short film entitled &#8220;Hats&#8221; began. The first shot panned out to show a woman, with coarse patchy hair and a massive grin cackling as she tried on the most extravagant yellow hat with massive straw brim. She looked into the camera and said, &#8220;Yes. This is me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At this point, I have to admit to no longer being able to see very well due to the large amounts of tears gushing down my face &#8211; so if my descriptions fall short somehow, I apologise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rosettalife.org/" target="_blank">Rosetta Life</a> is a charity dedicated to working with people who have life-threatening illnesses.  <a href="http://www.rosettalive.org/theatre/" target="_blank">“The Magical Glow of the Co Op”</a> was a rehearsed reading as part of the <a href="http://www.rosettalive.org/" target="_blank">Rosetta Live</a> celebrations that featured the work of two hospices; Birmingham St Mary’s Hospice in Selly Park and St Giles Hospice Whittington, near Lichfield. Working together, more than 30 hospice users generated a performance script that looked at the choices people face when dying and the difficulties they face when making these choices.  In the 10 chairs sat 3 professional actors (the fourth was lying on the bed), 6 hospice users and one care professional.  Throughout the reading hospice users took to the stage to perform alongside the professional actors which really added weight and poignancy (as well as some unexpected laughs) to the evening.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter" title="John Flitcroft and Lucy Tuck" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3390/3601504302_2f88eeb252_o.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The performance finished with an aftershow discussion called ‘The Big Conversation – Let’s Talk About Living’.  The audience were invited to ask questions of the panel of hospice users who had taken part in the perfomance, health care practitioners and the actors who were still in character.  Until then, I had kept my eyes focused on the stage, hoping to hide anonymously at the edge of a row.  However once the lights went up, I really looked at the audience &#8211; at those people who had chosen to spend a night in the company of such a taboo subject.   The audience consisted of every economic/social/cultural background you can imagine, all sat in one small venue watching their loved ones perform, or the words of their lost loved one performed by their peers.  And there were no dry eyes.  Not one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel excited that Birmingham East and North PCT were brave enough not only to fund this project, but also to enable Birmingham to become the first UK city that is making steps to talk openly about how it&#8217;s citizens positively approach life as it draws to a close, as well as how they want to be remembered. Created in Birmingham has always highlighted exciting and relevant creative ventures linked to the city, and I can&#8217;t think of a more perfect project to write about in my first post proper.  Actors, hospice users, venue and funders are all citizens of Birmingham, breaking new and important (if at times uncomfortable) ground.  This was a performance that anyone touched by illness should see, not just the friends and families of those performing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The Magical Glow of the Co-op&#8221; was just one small part of the <a href="http://www.rosettalive.org/" target="_blank">Rosetta Live</a> celebration running throughout June. It culminates in a film premiere at <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Electric Cinema</a> on 29th June commencing at 6.00pm.  To book, please contact bookings@rosettalive.org &#8211; I know I&#8217;m going to be there.</p>
