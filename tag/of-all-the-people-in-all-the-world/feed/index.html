				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t want to come across like <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VF_uOgyBK1c">an advert for football on Sky</a>, but there are three things happening in Birmingham this weekend and they&#8217;re all (to coin a phrase) kind of a big deal:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/">Project X Presents</a> (Sat 13th, 8pm to 3am) &#8211; this promises to be very cool indeed.Â  Comedy, music, visuals, weird buzzing boxes&#8230; A new city centre venue to explore, sensible drink prices and only a tenner.Â  Check out the website for pics of how it&#8217;s all been coming together over the past week.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/ofallthepeople/">Of All The People In All The World</a> (today, 6.30pm until 5 Oct) &#8211; Stan&#8217;s Cafe bring their big, crazy and thought-provoking show to Birmingham.Â  &#8220;112 tonnes of rice â€“ 6.7 billion grains â€“ one for everyone on the planet&#8221;.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> (all weekend) &#8211; the UK&#8217;s biggest arts festival.Â  If you can&#8217;t find anything to enjoy then&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t know.Â  It&#8217;s not as if people haven&#8217;t been trying to <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/09/10/finding-your-way-around-artsfest/">help you find the good stuff</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;ll probably be some collective memory shenanigans coming up so if you go to any of these things and take photos/video/blog about them then chuck a link here and it&#8217;ll go into the pot.</p>
<p>Oh, and tag anything Stan&#8217;s Cafe-related with &#8216;thericeshow&#8217; for it to feed into the clever little website for <a href="http://www.thericeshow.com/">The Rice Show</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" rel="lightbox[2035]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2043" title="artsfest1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="187" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/artsfest1-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> is a big sprawling beast of a festival and a difficult one to wrangle from a listings perspective. A few people have chipped in with their take on how things could/should be presented but for me, while all of them help in some way, none of them really hit the nail on the head.Â  Still here are they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every event has been manfully wrangled into the <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/events/search?search=artsfest">Live Brum database</a></li>
<li>Jon Bounds has <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/5572128/Artsfest-Programme">scanned the programme and put it online</a></li>
<li>He&#8217;s also put together <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=100285685412338791851.00045623f1c67b8d55eb9&amp;ll=52.478298,-1.904819&amp;spn=0.006051,0.018883&amp;z=16">a map showing what&#8217;s happening where</a> (but not when)</li>
<li>Matthew Somerville from <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/">Dracos.co.uk</a> has put together a <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/play/artsfest/">searchable list of events listed by time</a>, not location</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the small team running Artsfest wouldn&#8217;t have the budget or reach to put something like the above together, so it&#8217;s great to see the local community take it upon themselves.</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s of any use to anyone, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m planning to do.Â  Or at least what I think looks interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Friday evening</strong></p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s fun takes place against the backdrop of <a href="http://www.lightnight.co.uk/">Light Night</a>, of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stan&#8217;s Cafe are opening the doors of AE Harris Factory (110 Northwood Street, B3 1SZ) for Of All The People In All The World (6.30-9pm)</li>
<li>From 7pm (not sure until when) there are two interesting things happening at the Council House.Â  Definitely worth seeing are <a href="http://www.willard-wigan.com/">Willard Wigan&#8217;s astounding micro sculptures</a>.Â  Sonia Bhamra will be Painting With Light in another room which might be worth a look if you&#8217;re there</li>
<li>Gallery 10 at BM&amp;AG has <a href="http://www.comfortism.co.uk/">Comfortism</a> who, I think, mixes up poetry, theatre and stand-up with the odd bit of audience participation.Â  Could be interesting</li>
<li>At 8pm there&#8217;s a parade from the Pavillions to Centenary Square</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/late-night-light-night">Town Hall present Late Night Light Night</a> and they&#8217;ll be open from 8pm for perfomances by Soweto Kinch, The Sub Ensemble, Manga and Maylight (who I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s the tricky one.Â  There&#8217;s loads happening so the best thing might just be to go for a wander around the city centre and see what you stumble across.Â  That said&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nic Gaunt&#8217;s exhibition &#8216;<a href="http://www.newrotunda.co.uk/about%20the%20project.html">The Rotunda: 21 Stories</a>&#8216; will be at The Pavillions all day</li>
<li>From 3.30pm to 4.30pm there&#8217;s Raw Magic which is &#8220;a visual installation and promenade performance built into a maze of tents, for audiences to explore and choose which direction they would like to take&#8221;.Â  Some of the people here were involved in the very popular B1 Labyrinths from this year&#8217;s Fierce Festival</li>
<li>From 8pm to 10pm BRB, CBSO and Birmingham Opera Company share the Centenary Square stage for one of the weekend&#8217;s big items.Â  Plus there&#8217;ll be fireworks.</li>
<li>After that it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.projectxpresents.com/">Project X Presents</a> for me.Â  It&#8217;s not Artsfest-related but it does look pretty exciting, so that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I&#8217;m functioning at 12pm then I&#8217;ll want some &#8216;beautiful heartwarming acoustic/electronica music&#8217;.Â  At the Custard Factory, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/elliotjack">Elliot Jack</a> will be playingjust that.</li>
<li>After that I might wander into the Custard Factory Theatre for some short flicks courtesy of Shortcuts</li>
<li>From 7pm <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/08/19/needle-thread-theatre-presents-between-the-lines/">Needle &amp; Thread Theatre are doing the rather charming-looking &#8216;Between The Lines&#8217;</a> &#8211; walking theatre around the Central Library.Â  This is on on Saturday too (call 07530 939 380 to book a free place)</li>
<li>It&#8217;s Kerrangfest in Centenary Square from 12pm with The Mexicolas, The Metros, Envy &amp; Other Sins and The Levellers later in the evening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, whether I actually get round a fraction of all of that is another question.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Birmingham theatre company <a href="http://stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> are presenting their show <a href="http://stanscafe.co.uk/ofallthepeople/">Of All The People In All The World</a> in Birmingham from 13 September to 5 October.</p>
<p>Since 2003, when a smaller &#8216;UK version&#8217; was <a href="http://stanscafe.co.uk/ofallthepeople/birmingham.html">shown in Birmingham Cathedral</a>, the show has visited (among others) Australia, Slovenia, Canada, the USA, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and various places around the UK.Â  This time it will be turning up at the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=AE+Harris+B3+1SZ&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.48555,-1.909561&amp;spn=0.00656,0.017552&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">AE Harris Factory</a> in/near the Jewellery Quarter.</p>
<p>This will be only the second showing of the larger &#8216;world version&#8217;, the scope of which is kinda mind-blowing:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you approach this former metalworking factory you will be given a grain of rice. This grain is you. Inside lots of people are waiting for you, billions of them, each represented by a grain of rice. 112 tonnes of rice â€“ 6.7 billion grains â€“ one for everyone on the planet.</p>
<p>As you explore the extraordinary landscape of rice hills and mountains stretching out in front of you, you discover every pile represents a different population and that together these piles tell hundreds of stories, stories of the worldâ€™s people and politics, history and current affairs.</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;re invited to <a href="http://stanscafe.co.uk/ofallthepeople/statcentre/index.html">suggest the statistics that will be visualised in the show</a>.</p>
<p>For an idea of the scale of this production there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/ofallthepeople/worldimages.html">an image gallery on the Stan&#8217;s Cafe site</a> and there&#8217;s a promo vid too:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iDWcuBygAUw&amp;color1=11645361&amp;color2=13619151&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iDWcuBygAUw&amp;color1=11645361&amp;color2=13619151&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent"></embed></object></p>
<p>Entry to this extraordinary show is only Â£2.50.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="http://www.podnosh.com/blog/2008/08/18/of-all-the-people-in-all-the-world-finally-comes-to-brum/">Podnosh</a> and <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2008/08/rice-to-be-you-to-be-you-%E2%80%94-rice.html">BiNS</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, while I think of it <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/birmingham-business-news/media-marketing-news/2008/06/09/stan-s-cafe-leads-the-call-for-a-return-to-creativity-65233-21043053/">the piece by Stan&#8217;s Cafe&#8217;s James Yarker in the Birmingham Post</a> is worth another read.</p>
