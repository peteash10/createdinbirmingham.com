				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">As of this month Created in Birmingham is no longer funded by Creative Republic, this is because the blog has achieved its original objectives, and along the way become a great resource for the creative and cultural sector in Birmingham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This now means that CiB needs to become self sustainable, and to do this needs to call upon all of those organisations, companies, galleries, theatres, festivals and individuals who have benefited from CiB in the past to invest in the future of the website by advertising.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone" title="CiB" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/untitled-1-copy2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="130" /><strong><br />
So, why advertise?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Created in Birmingham reaches approx. 20,0000 visitors a month, which means you could reach that amount of people, letting them know about your services, exhibition, event or anything you want to tell people about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike most other websites, CiB is dedicated to a particular sector &#8211; creative and cultural, which means the audience or potential customers you are trying to reach are right here. It is also dedicated to a particular place &#8211; Birmingham, but is not only read by people from the West Midlands, but worldwide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2 week advertising spot: £75.00<br />
4 week advertising spot: £140.00</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2 week advertising spot for charities or companies under 6 months old: £50.00<br />
4 week advertising spot for charities or companies under 6 months old: £90.00</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adverts will be a 125pxl x 125pxl image, which will link to your website. At the end of your advertising period I can give you the number of times your advert was clicked on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Payment options:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pay via Paypal &#8211; to email address: <a href="mailto:Createdinbirmingham@gmail.com" target="_blank">Createdinbirmingham [at] gmail.com</a><br />
Pay via invoice &#8211; please provide full details via email and you will be invoiced on the first day of advertising.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Advertising rates are negotiable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Email &#8211; <a href="mailto:Createdinbirmingham@gmail.com">Createdinbirmingham [at] gmail.com</a></p>
