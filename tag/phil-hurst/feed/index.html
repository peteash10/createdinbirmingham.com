				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some news from Sutton Coldfield! It&#8217;s been a while but this is a good one. <a href="http://philhurst.wordpress.com/">Phil Hurst</a> emailed to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently running an event at the Station Pub in Sutton Coldfield trying to promote and encourage new writing within Birmingham and the surrounding area.  The event stages its second night on the 24th November and I would appreciate it if you could promote it in some way on your blog.  We are especially looking for actors and actresses who would be prepared to donate their time to reading some of the scripts, although I we also need some more scripts for the upcoming event.</p></blockquote>
<p>The night is called Semper Station and the next one is billed as celebrating the anticipation of Christmas (rather than the event itself).</p>
<p>If you want more info then hie thee hence to the <a href="http://sempergroup.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/semper-station-ii-anticipation/">Semper Writer&#8217;s Group</a> website. Submissions are required by 15 November.</p>
