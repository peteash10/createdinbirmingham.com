				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taken (wholesale) from the <a href="http://www.artsjobs.org.uk/index.php?id=25&amp;ne_source=dailynews_plain&amp;ne_post_id=12534">Arts Council&#8217;s &#8216;Arts News&#8217; email</a>. A venue doesn&#8217;t seem to have been set but it should be somewhere around Birmingham.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Theatre Lab is a place where theatre practitioners can experiment, and try new things, that perhaps they havenâ€™t had the opportunity to practice in their day-to-day work. Each theatre lab has a theme so as to give the day a context, however this does not have to be restrictive. The idea is to experiment and push things to the limits, some experiments may fail some may succeed. The emphasis is on what we discover during the process.</p>
<p>As it is the festive time of year we thought Pantomime had to be the theme for this months Theatre Lab</p>
<p>Every year pantomime explodes on to the nations stage with four weeks of twice daily sell out audiences.</p>
<p>What is its secret? What are its ingredients?</p>
<p>These are questions we will be trying to answer.</p>
<p>So come along and find your inner dame, principal boy or Villain.</p>
