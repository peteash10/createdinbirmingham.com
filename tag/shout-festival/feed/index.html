<p>I&#8217;ve got nothing to base this on particularly, but something tells me that the <a title="Shout Festival" href="http://www.shoutfestival.co.uk/">Shout Festival</a> has been growing year on year. Is that right? I&#8217;m not sure what it is &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s something about the programme or the list of partner organisations involved. Maybe, heading into its third year, it&#8217;s something to do with a natural maturing and putting down of roots. Hmm. Thoughts welcomed &#8211; I could be well off on this.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a title="Shout Festival 2011 programme" href="http://www.shoutfestival.co.uk/2011-Programme/p103/c20">the 2011 programme is online</a> and the festival starts at the beginning of November.</p>

<p>Birmingham&#8217;s festival of queer culture &#8211; <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/">Shout</a> &#8211; is taking place from 4 &#8211; 23 November, with a wide range of events happening across the city in exploration and celebration of LBGT communities and individuals.</p>
<blockquote><p>Visibility and Invisibility are major themes of this year’s festival  providing opportunities to increase the visibility of the LGBT community  within the city and to make arts and culture a more visible part of our  own lives.</p>
<p>But the festival themes also enable us to ask challenging  questions about the invisibility of some sections of our own community  in particular those who are old, have a disability or are from Black,  Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/Performance/Visible--Launch-Weekend/38">launch weekend</a> is being held at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk">mac</a> on 4 &#8211; 7 November, hosting three theatre performances and a <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/Film/Woubi-Cheri/4">documentary screening</a>. The first night kicks off at 6.30pm in the Terrace Gallery at mac, and will showcase live performances, interventions and the premiere of new work by artist, <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/Visual-Arts/Qasim-Riza-Shaheen/1">Qasim Riza Shaheen</a>, which will be proceeded by an 8 week residency.</p>
<p>The festival will continue to present events in visual arts, film, live performance,  comedy, artist talks, research and social events. For a full run down  of what&#8217;s on, take a look at the <a href="http://www.getreadytoshout.org.uk/Whats-On/p103/c20">Shout website</a>, where you can also purchase tickets and find out more about associated artists and venues.</p>
