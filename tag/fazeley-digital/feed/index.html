				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Only 3 short months after their launch, <a href="http://modx-fazeley.spring-php.com/mission_statement.php" target="_blank">Fazeley Studios</a> are now hosting their own <a href="http://www.fazeleydigital.com/" target="_blank">digital festival</a> which aims to bring together the city&#8217;s creative businesses through a variety of events, including the usual seminars, debates and networking opportunities, but also including Fazeley&#8217;s own innovative slant of unconferences, swap shops and media mash-ups including Second Life, Twitter and live video streams.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="My Dads on twitter..." src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/3611745354_9843249ce9_o.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="340" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event which has most piqued my curioisity is entitled &#8220;My Dad&#8217;s on Twitter but he doesn&#8217;t know why&#8221;.  More than just another opportunity to &#8216;talk shop&#8217;, this event promises to collate the ideas and input of attendees into a collaborative group mind map exploring how and why people use social media.  In addition, after the event there will be an opportunity for an online audience to have input into the map as well.  I&#8217;m keen to see how this will utilise <a href="http://bubbl.us/" target="_blank">Bubbl.us</a> &#8211; something I stumbled across earlier this week, and which looks like another great free tool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event which has most piqued my TASTEBUDS however, is definitely the festival finale &#8211; a grand high tea for 300 creative workers in Fazeley Studio&#8217;s magnificently restored 19th century chapel reception.  Fazeley currently provides a high tea for tenants every Thursday and have decided to build upon the success of this for the festival.  I&#8217;ve been promised there are exciting and secretive things planned for this event which will be unveiled on the day, but if the promise of the tea alone isn&#8217;t enough of an incentive, there will also be a preview of the latest <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/303/the_last_few_mosquitoes/" target="_blank">Ikon Eastside exhibition</a> &#8211; an installation by an emerging Chinese artist called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Zhen" target="_blank">Xu Zhen</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For more details on all of the events taking place during the festival, the <a href="http://www.fazeleydigital.com/" target="_blank">Fazeley Digital</a> website will keep you in the loop,  as well as provide opportunities to sign-up for certain events and provide feedback/interact with others.</p>
