				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d post my response to an email I received from someone the other day. The emailer said (and these are a couple of extracts):</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently looking for creative projects to get involved with in the Birmingham area, specifically film or media based projects. I have lots of transferable skills through studying film on my course and I am looking for possible work experience (unpaid) in TV, film or any kind of production, as a runner, film grip and/or any position where the skills I have may come in useful.</p>
<p>My biggest focus is finding opportunities, getting out there and getting involved in anything I can, from possible collaborations to arts events, workshops, anything to keep me busy and anything that allows me to be creative and continues the type of work I was doing on my course.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of anything specific but gave a few starting places. I operate on the assumption that CiB readers know much more than I do, so if anyone can add anything then please do in the comments. My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any specific opportunities at the moment. It&#8217;s a bit of a funny time for that kind of thing at the moment, what with Screen WM (who used to put on events and so on) closing down a few months back and Creative England (the body taking their place) only just getting up and running. In the meantime it might be worth looking at <a href="http://www.bsin.co.uk/">http://www.bsin.co.uk/</a> and seeing what they&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p>Also, have a look at these events, get yourself along and see who you meet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.producersforum.org.uk/">http://www.producersforum.org.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/">http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.helloculture.net/">http://www.helloculture.net/</a> (this is on tomorrow)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Maybe see what courses are happening at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/ ">http://www.macarts.co.uk/</a> or <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/">http://light-house.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the closure of the Creative Partnerships Programme, <a title="Bright Space" href="http://www.brightspace.org.uk/">Bright Space</a> announced that they would be closing. Today&#8217;s their last day.</p>
<p>This from <a title="Stan's Cafe" href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1832">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s sad because Brightspace were behind a huge number of inspirational projects that took artists into schools to work creatively with students and teachers. Now, despite a great report from OFSTED setting out the great value of these projects, the plug as been pulled, the axe has fallen, the bubble burst, the goose cooked, the turkey plucked, the swan sung and the full stopped.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d lost track of what&#8217;s happening with <a title="Creative England" href="http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/">Creative England</a> &#8211; I thought it was going to be based on a partnership of all the screen agencies <a href="http://www.rewiredpr.com/news/entry/screen_wm_brings_curtain_down_as_creative_england_takes_on_support_role/">but here&#8217;s a press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday 30th September 2011, regional screen agency Screen WM will bring the curtain down on nine years of support for the screen media industries in the West Midlands and welcome Creative England as the new umbrella body for the creative sector.</p>
<p>The closure of <a title="Screen WM" href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Screen WM</a> follows the coalition government’s decision to replace the <a title="UK Film Council" href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank">UK Film Council’s</a> support for film-making, which core-funded the regional screen agencies, with funding through the British Film Institute.</p></blockquote>
<p>All the best to the folks working at these organisations who are moving on.</p>
<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m predicting a few more posts like this over the next few months.</p>

Since announcing the demise of the UK Film Council things have been a bit up in the air. Some of those things are still up there, but we know a bit more now. You can read the full <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7603.aspx">official announcement from DCMS here</a>.</p>
<p>On a local level, and in short, the regional screen agencies (including <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/">Screen WM</a> locally) are being &#8216;recalibrated&#8217; into three hubs; Creative North, Creative Central and Creative South. Creative England will be the overarching organisation.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.20minutos.tv/video/wovXroJzoG-prueba-avi/0/">I, for one, welcome our new film overlords</a>.</p>
<p>More information will be coming in the new year but in the meantime here&#8217;s some explanation/more intelligent comment:</p>
