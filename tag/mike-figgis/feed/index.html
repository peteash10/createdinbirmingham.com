				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend was one the most exciting and eventful of the year, but unfortunately I have come down with a nasty bug which meant I missed it all. I had plans to don my reporters hat and head off to see internationally revered film maker <a href="http://boilerhouse.co.uk/news/archive/2009/02/18/Mike_Figgis_to_speak_at_Boilerhouse_Voices" target="_blank">Mike Figgis speaking at the Boilerhouse</a> (Thursday) <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Flatpack Festival</a> (Friday / Saturday / Sunday) and <a href="http://www.little-earthquake.com/hauntingintroductionpage.htm" target="_blank">The Haunting</a> (Friday night). It seems I am not the only one Nicky from <a href="http://digbeth.org/2009/03/poorly-bad-timing/" target="_blank">Digbeth is Good</a> has also missed out on all the fun due to the mystery bug.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3277" title="Floodgate Kino" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/3353922226_0344296c52.jpg" alt="Floodgate Kino" width="500" height="281" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/3353922226_0344296c52.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/3353922226_0344296c52-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><em>Floodgate Kino by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sharl/" target="_blank">sharl</a></em></p>
<p>Thank goodness for Flatpack&#8217;s guest blogger Eleanor McKeown. London based Eleanor works for quarterly cinema magazine <a href="http://www.electricsheepmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Electric Sheep</a> and popped up from the capital to experience the weird wonderment of Flatpack Festival, and to stay in the historic <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-birmingham_backtobacks" target="_blank">back to backs</a>. Her very specific knowlege base and the fact she is an out of towner makes for interesting reading, though photos to illustrate the words would have been nice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twice Oscar-nominated film director Mike Figgis will be coming to Birmingham on 12 March as the latest speaker in the <a href="http://www.boilerhouse.co.uk/about/voices" target="_blank">Boilerhouse Voices</a> series of events staged by Jewellery Quarter based communications consultancy Boilerhouse. Figgis will address an invited audience of Boilerhouse guests, but a limited number of tickets will be available to creative industries professionals on an application basis.</p>

<p>Mike Figgis, whose Hollywood credits include Leaving Las Vegas and Internal Affairs, is a visionary filmmaker who thrives on taking artistic risks. For the last decade, he has been working at the cutting edge of creative digital video. His film Timecode was a product of this, shot in a single day without a script and using four digital cameras to create separate stories unfolding simultaneously in real time on a quadruple split screen.</p>
<p>If you would like to apply for a ticket contact Rob Adams: <a href="mailto:rob.adams@boilerhouse.co.uk" target="_blank">rob.adams@boilerhouse.co.uk</a>.</p>
