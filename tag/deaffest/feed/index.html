<blockquote><p>The weekend of festivities will include screenings of films produced by UK and International Deaf filmmakers; Young Deaffest, which showcases work produced by young Deaf filmmakers; and a conference on Opportunities for Deaf Filmmakers, with panel discussions on how to pitch for funding for a short or feature film, a new Deaf TV channel and content for new online and mobile platforms</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.deaffest.co.uk/Deaffest/2008prog.htm">The programme</a> looks quite impressively stuffed.Â  Tickets are free, save for the Saturday night&#8217;s gala event (Â£12.50 and available from <a href="http://www.theticketsellers.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.theticketsellers.co.uk</a>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found this summary of Artsfest 2008 over at <a href="http://www.joe-bunting.com/club/node">CLUB</a>:</p>
<ul>
<blockquote>
<li>Friday is funny light show and parade day</li>
<li>Saturday is fireworks day</li>
<li>Sunday is Kerrangfest day with the Levellers</li>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>Which is pretty good but, although the official programme&#8217;s not out yet, I&#8217;ve been having a bit of a rummage about to see what&#8217;s on.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/08/27/light-night/">Light Night</a>.Â  One of the buildings to be illuminated is the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/late-night-light-night">Town Hall which will be hosting a free event</a> from 8pm on the Friday featuring Manga, Soweto Kinch, The Sub Ensemble and Maylight.</p>
<p>Also on Friday there&#8217;s the free <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/event.php?eid=69753825243&amp;ref=nf">Reggae Rockz Festival 2008</a> from 8pm to 11pm in Centenary Square.Â  Unfortunately <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/event.php?eid=69753825243&amp;ref=nf">on the Facebook event page</a> the organisers spend all their time bleating about a lack of promotion from Artsfest and don&#8217;t get round to telling us much about what they&#8217;l be doing.Â  The Beat are playing, that much is sure.Â  The <a href="http://www.reggaerockz.co.uk/">Reggae Rockz website</a> manages to be even less informative.Â  Ah well.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>It looks like <a href="http://www.dholfest.com/">Dholfest 2008</a> is the biggie here &#8211; an attempt to break the world record for the most dhol players in one place (currently 314 players in Sandwell in 1999).Â  They&#8217;re aiming for 500 this time.Â  This one will be held in Victoria and Centenary Squares.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Custard Factory will be hosting a day of hip hop with Mylz from <a href="http://www.heducation.com/">Heducation</a> and Madman the Greatest down to perform.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Sunday is Kerrangfest day with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thisbeautifulthief">This Beautiful Thief</a> and The Levellers the only bands I&#8217;ve spotted so far.</p>
<p><strong>Across the weekend</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.spaghettigazetti.com/2008/08/artsfest-2008-birminighams-big-art.html">Spaghetti Gazetti</a> has info about the weekend&#8217;s poetry performances.</p>
<p>This year the ShortCuts film programme will be extended slightly, with &#8220;a more relaxed, experimental programme of films made by local and international film makers&#8221; on the Sunday and a set of fims programmed in conjunction with <a href="http://www.deaffest.co.uk">Deaffest</a> across the weekend.Â  There&#8217;s more about those in <a href="http://artsfest365.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/shortcuts-film-programme-update/">this post from the Artsfest blog</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much more to come and I&#8217;ll let you know when I see a full programme lying around the internet somewhere.</p>

<p>Some great news from the peeps at <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/2008/06/some-exciting-news/">7 Inch Cinema</a> landed on the virtual doormat today.Â  The <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/">Flatpack Festival</a> is the worthy recipient of funding for the next three years, securing it&#8217;s future and allowing the organisers to maybe think a little bigger.</p>
<p>Peter Buckingham from the <a href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/14426">UK Film Council</a> (who are providing the funding) said of Flatpack:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their innovative approach to screening films in churches, warehouses and shopping centres as well as cinemas and gallery spaces is a brilliant idea because it helps to attract new audiences to some great short films, animation and live film events</p></blockquote>
<p>Flatpack 3 will take place in Feb 2009 and will launch &#8220;with a tribute to Birminghamâ€™s pioneering film showman <a href="http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/978229">Waller Jeffs</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deaffest.co.uk/Deaffest/index.html">DeafFest</a> at Wolverhampton Light House have also received funding so well done to them too.</p>
<p>Last word goes to the understandably chuffed Flatpack producers:</p>
<blockquote><p>without going all Oscar-night about it, it wouldnâ€™t have been possible without all the filmmakers, volunteers, artists, promoters, technicians, funders, venues and enthusiastic punters who have chipped in to help us get this far. So thanks a lot, and hereâ€™s to Flatpack III in February 2009 and beyondâ€¦</p></blockquote>
