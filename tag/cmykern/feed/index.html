<p>James Griffin is a 22 year old graphic designer working out of this fair city.Â  He&#8217;s running a great blog called <a href="http://cmykern.com/">CMYKern</a> picking up on bits of design that catch his eye, just the sort of blog I have a large soft spot for (they&#8217;re great for adding colour to your RSS reader).</p>
<p>The scope of his posts aren&#8217;t limited geographically but he does seem to profile some local things every now and again, including <a href="http://cmykern.com/?p=987">this post on Jibbering Art&#8217;s recent Shambala exhibition</a> where he makes an excellent point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being the second largest city in Britain we need to make the most of this type of event and embrace the cities creativity. I didnâ€™t realize how much stuff there was going on in Birmingham until I moved back here after my studies. Birmingham doesnâ€™t lack creativity, or public space, as is apparent by this exhibition, what it does lack is a medium in which to reach out to people. A medium to let people know what is going on. I stumbled across this exhibition by chance and it saddens me to think that I might not have caught up with this exhibition had it not been for a chance encounter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes!Â  Excellently said.Â  As much as I&#8217;d like to trumpet CiB&#8217;s efforts in this area, I spend much more time meeting people who don&#8217;t read this blog than people who do.Â  There&#8217;s much more to be done in making people aware of what&#8217;s going on.</p>
