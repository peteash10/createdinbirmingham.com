<p>(<em>photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/5193541294/">Pete Ashton</a></em>)</p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/news_item.php?nid=132">Birmingham Opera Company&#8217;s staging of Stravinsky&#8217;s The Wedding</a> on Friday night &#8211; the dress rehearsal, to be precise. Claire Ferrell has <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/11/17/stravinskys-the-wedding/comment-page-1/#comment-61858">commented on our previous post</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>I attended this last night, the performance was absolutely incredible. I am a huge fan of Birmingham Opera Company, they blow me away every year. We are so lucky to have such an exciting organisation in Bham.</p></blockquote>
<p>And I have to say I absolutely agree. It was great, and had more ideas, cheekiness and more serious things to say packed into its 30 minute running time than just about anything else I&#8217;ve seen this year.</p>
<p>A proper review of the show won&#8217;t be worth me writing &#8211; if I&#8217;m honest I&#8217;m still not quite sure what happened. I hardly remember the music and had no idea what was going on most of the time. <em>Everything</em> was going on most of the time. It was more an installation than anything with the cast (hundreds of brides and grooms) running riot throughout AE Harris.</p>
<p>Things started as soon as we started drifting into the building, with the cast getting into character and assuming odd positions all over the place. I know I&#8217;m not the only person to have taken this picture:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Man in a bucket by chrisunitt, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisunitt/5194984172/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5194984172_782b2a87c3.jpg" alt="Man in a bucket" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>And to think this was &#8216;just&#8217; a quick little thing to fill the gap before a bigger production in the spring of next year. Can&#8217;t wait for that.</p>
<p>Now I think of it, there&#8217;s been quite a bit of Stravinsky around recently. BRB included <a href="http://www.brb.org.uk/masque/index.htm?act=production&amp;urn=4952">The Firebird</a> in Russian Steps in 2008 and the 3D audiovisual spectacular version of <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/stravinskys-rite-of-spring-3d-performance">The Rite of Spring</a> will be at the Symphony Hall next year. Anyone for Petroushka?</p>

<p>This weekend <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk">Birmingham Opera Company</a> will be presenting <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/news_item.php?nid=132">Stravinsky&#8217;s The Wedding</a> at <a href="http://www.aeharris.co.uk/">A E Harris</a>. The experimental performance will last half an hour, as audiences are drawn around the space, with no formal seating  and  performance area.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Wedding is a screaming, shrieking, flat out masterpiece with its  rhythmic drive and unique sound world – 4 virtuoso pianists on grand  pianos, a dazzling array of percussion, 4 soloists and a chorus. Written  as a ballet in 1923 for Diaghilev’s Ballet Russes, Stravinsky drew on  Russian traditions to conjure up a vivid and intense depiction of the  old ways, and the not so old!</p></blockquote>
<p>Performances take place on Friday 19th November 8.30pm / Saturday 20th November 7.30pm &amp; 9pm / Sunday 21st November 4pm &amp; 5.30pm.</p>
<p>Tickets are £7.50 (£5 concessions) and can be booked through <a href="https://www.theticketsellers.co.uk/buy_tickets/organisers/?id=3725">The Ticket Sellers</a> on<strong> 0844 870 0000</strong></p>
