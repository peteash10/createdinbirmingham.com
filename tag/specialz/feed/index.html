				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This one knocked me back on my heels &#8211; a really (and I mean <em>really</em>) impressive company doing amazing work on, quite literally, some of the world&#8217;s biggest stages.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.specialz.co.uk/">Specialz Ltd</a> is Keith Owen and Dave Smith and they describe their company as a &#8216;Production Design and Manufacturing House&#8217;. That is to say that they make lights like these for Radiohead&#8217;s 2008 world tour:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3.jpg" rel="lightbox[4575]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4576" title="radiohead3" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3.jpg" alt="radiohead3" width="500" height="281" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve worked on sets for the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Pink, Girls Aloud, Kylie Minogue and U2. They also <a href="http://www.specialz.co.uk/blacksabbath.html">refurbished the Black Sabbath Cross from 1981</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Acquired as a piece of Black Sabbath  				memorabilia by Music Superstore PMT<span> </span>The Black Sabbath Cross found it’s way in the Specialz  				Workshop for a refit.<span> </span>The Birmingham branch of PMT Music store plan to hang the  				piece, dating from 1981 tour, in the shop.<span> </span>However, with most of fittings missing and the fact  				they’d have to sell twice as many instruments to pay the  				electricity bill if it was rebuilt with the original light  				sources.</p>
<p>Keith Owen, Specialz Technical Director,  				sourced some obsolete spinnings and repopulated the piece with  				60 1.5w LED clusters which only draw a total of 300w max.<span> </span>He then used a prismatic lens to amplify the light  				output.</p></blockquote>
<p>Impressive stuff. They do art installations and all sorts too. In fact, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much they can&#8217;t do and the reports I&#8217;ve found on them elsewhere are glowing &#8211; <a href="www.i-pix.uk.com/downloads/RadioheadArticleUSA.pdf">there&#8217;s a PDF here</a> which effusively explains their role in the Radiohead stage set.</p>
