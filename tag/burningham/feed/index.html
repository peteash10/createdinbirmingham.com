				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday afternoon <a href="http://twitter.com/ChrisUnitt/status/85358129264603136">I asked Twitter</a> what I should write about next on CiB. I was given four topics and these are they (in reverse order).</p>
<p><strong>Digbeth v the JQ</strong> (via <a href="http://twitter.com/EleanorWi">@EleanorWi</a>)</p>
<p>Ooh, good one &#8211; the battle of the so called &#8216;creative quarters&#8217; &#8211; this could be fun. I&#8217;ve just moved from working in Digbeth to working in the Jewellery Quarter and Eleanor knows this, hence the request. FIGHT!</p>
<p>I shall now go on to disappoint with a bland appraisal of the two taken from my own point of view. Your experiences of the places may vary.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m enjoying the Jewellery Quarter. It&#8217;s nearer my house so cycling in is easier, there are useful amenities (there&#8217;s no need to get excited about cash machines around these parts) and there are some decent enough places to grab a drink after work.</p>
<p>The nightlife thing&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve never been keen on St Paul&#8217;s Square as a place to go out but, with <a href="http://www.urbanartbar.com/">UAB</a> book-ending things (with <a href="http://www.theredlionbirmingham.com/">The Red Lion</a> at one end, <a href="http://www.thelordclifden.com/">The Lord Cliffden</a> at the other) and places like <a href="http://www.vertubar.co.uk/">Vertu</a>, <a href="http://www.vaultsbirmingham.com/">The Vaults</a>, <a href="http://www.thedropforge.co.uk/">The Drop Forge</a> and soon <a href="http://www.therosevillatavern.co.uk/">The Rose Villa Tavern</a> in between, I reckon we could start to see more people around here of a weekend. There are restaurants here too.</p>
<p>As for the creativity/arts/culture angle, there&#8217;s a bigger emphasis on heritage over this side of town, while a a lot of the current activity feels hidden away and goes on behind closed studio and workshop doors. Other than <a href="http://www.aeharrisvenue.co.uk/">AE Harris</a> (which I love) there isn&#8217;t much by way of a decent venue &#8211; there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theasylumvenue.co.uk/">The Asylum</a> and <a href="http://www.blueorangetheatre.co.uk/">The Blue Orange Theatre</a> but neither currently has a schedule of events that grabs me. Also, everything over this side of town seems quite managed and smoothly polished (which isn&#8217;t necessarily praise but is definitely a contrast).</p>
<p>Digbeth is rougher round the edges but it wears its distinctiveness quite proudly on its sleeve. It&#8217;s more performative. It feels like the art and creativity spills out of <a href="http://www.eastsideprojects.org/">Eastside Projects</a>, <a href="http://www.grand-union.org.uk/">Grand Union</a>, <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">Vivid</a>, <a href="http://boxxed.co.uk/">Boxxed</a>, <a href="http://www.fazeleystudios.com/">Fazeley Studios</a> and onto the streets. It&#8217;s a place for music and visual arts to tumble towards. If you want a night out and you like your music then Digbeth, with the <a href="http://venues.meanfiddler.com/hmv-institute/home">Institute</a>, <a href="http://www.airbirmingham.com/">Air</a>, Space 2, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/rainbowevents">The Rainbow</a>, <a href="http://www.birminghamirishclub.co.uk/">Irish Centre</a>, <a href="http://www.theadam.co.uk/">Adam &amp; Eve</a> and others, can&#8217;t be beat.</p>
<p>Space must be cheaper there. That brings in the artist collectives, the gallery spaces and the graduates looking for their first studio space. It&#8217;s a shame a shame the developers have made such a mess of the place over the past few years though &#8211; too many decent places bulldozed leaving large swathes of cleared, fenced off land.</p>
<p>For a while, the <a href="http://custardfactory.co.uk/">Custard Factory</a> drifted into becoming a nightclub which I&#8217;m not sure was a good idea, but maybe that was a result of trying to pack lots of activity into a fairly small area. It seems to be moving away from that again. Besides, Digbeth is sprawling away from the Custard Factory these days and that&#8217;s no bad thing.</p>
<p>Both sides of town suffer from a bit of a visibility problem &#8211; directing people to either from the city centre is no easy task.</p>
<p>So, to ramble to a conclusion &#8211; horses for courses, innit.</p>
<p><strong>Comedy in Birmingham</strong> (via <a href="http://twitter.com/RosieHighlight">@RosieHighlight</a>)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to duck this one slightly and refer back to the post I wrote a few months back about <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/03/02/is-the-birmingham-comedy-scene-any-good/">comedy in Birmingham</a>. Although I&#8217;ve asked Ian and he&#8217;s reminded me about the Fat Penguin, Cheeky Monkey and Laughing Cows nights in Kings Heath/Moseley that are often overlooked. I&#8217;m not sure I mentioned <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/events/comedy">The Drum</a> as another venue for that sort of thing either.</p>
<p>The upshot of that previous conversation was that there&#8217;s a reasonable amount of stuff going on although we&#8217;re not quite world-beaters, there could be more and it could do with being more visible. Couldn&#8217;t that apply to pretty much <em>anything</em> we do here?</p>
<p><strong>Burning Ham</strong> (via <a href="http://twitter.com/LouisHudson">@LouisHudson</a>)</p>
<p>Louis is presumably referring to <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/burningham-exyzt">EXYZT&#8217;s contribution to this year&#8217;s Fierce Festival</a>. I wasn&#8217;t around Birmingham when most of the events were going on down there and <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/archives/1753">this round-up</a> made me a bit regretful of that. It&#8217;s good to see that they&#8217;ll be back to work on a new site for the next festival.</p>
<p><strong>Bunnies</strong> (via <a href="http://twitter.com/Ravonski">@Ravonski</a>)</p>
<p>With the whole arts funding situation having settled down somewhat and no more cuts looming in the immediate future, I haven&#8217;t had much cause to lighten a gloomy post by finishing with a picture of a bunny.</p>
<p>That said, I expect there&#8217;s still bad news to come as the effect of the earlier cuts comes to be felt. There&#8217;ll be a few more leaving parties, closed signs, permanently-out-of-office messages and euphemistic talk of &#8216;transitioning&#8217;.</p>
<p>So on that downbeat note, cue bunnies:</p>
