<p>I thought I&#8217;d have a root around for a few others.</p>
<p><a href="http://eyethief.blogspot.com/">Rajmeena</a> posts sketches, there are dribs and drabs on the <a href="http://www.retailbirmingham.co.uk/category/blog/">Retail Birmingham blog</a>, <a href="http://wecreate.org.uk/">We Create</a> have a blog that occasionally features &#8216;about young British fashion designers&#8217; although not so much recently. <a href="http://labbmagazine.blogspot.com/">LABB Magazine&#8217;s blog</a> goes in for loads of pics. <a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/">Fused</a> cover fashion from time to time too.</p>
<p>Selina Jervis is from Birmingham but not around the city so much as far as I can tell. Her <a href="http://flyingsaucer.typepad.com/">Flying Saucer blog</a> has been popular for a while and it&#8217;s interesting to see they&#8217;ve recently snapped her up as a guest blogger on <a href="http://www.browsebullring.co.uk/blogs/">Browse Bullring</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers to <a href="http://twitter.com/jim_b">Jim</a> for pointing me towards <a href="http://vintagereflection.wordpress.com/">Vintage Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>There must be more out there&#8230; (*hint*)</p>

Not quite sure what the deal is with this one. They&#8217;ve got a DIY print studio and are looking for people to submit designs for them to use on T-shirts and so on. A physical shop is apparently coming in summer 09, in the meantime they&#8217;re up online with a website (coming soon) and this blog</li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamusic.com/newsdetails.php?news_id=772">Birmingham Music</a><br />
&#8220;The Town Hall and Symphony Hall website have launched a new online booking system for their events&#8230;  Also, as an introductory offer, you can take advantage of free postage on all bookings up to November 30th&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dg7qn7h5_0hph5j5hg">Draft Vision for a Birmingham Photospace</a><br />
The next meeting about this is on Tues 14 October at 6.30pm in the Library cafe, Birmingham city centre.  Seek out the Birmingham Flickr group for how the discussion about this is going; this is a link to the draft vision they&#8217;ve prepared</li>
<li><a href="http://flipfestivalblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/grads-on-walls-event/">Flip Blog &#8211; Grads On Walls Event</a><br />
The Flip Animation folk put out a reminder for the Animation Forum WM&#8217;s Grads on Walls event on Monday (good to see people talking up other people&#8217;s events &#8211; a very smart thing to do, I&#8217;d say)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stylebirmingham.com/style-news/birminghams-most-stylish">Birminghams Most Stylish &#8211; Style Birmingham</a><br />
&#8220;The 500 people who have made it through this year&#8217;s Style Search will be whittled down to just ten this weekend at a special party at Gatecrasher&#8221;.  Why am I linking to this? Um&#8230; just spreading the joy I guess</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scriptonline.net/screen.html">Script screenwriting course</a><br />
&#8220;Script, in association with Outside Centre, presents an in-depth Introduction to Screenwriting Course&#8221; at Wolverhampton&#8217;s Light House</li>
<li><a href="http://plusdesignexpo.blogspot.com/2008/10/fazeley-studios-2008-plus-venue.html">Plus+: Fazeley Studios 2008 Plus Venue</a><br />
Is it me or does the text in the link make no sense. Basically, Fazeley Studios has been chosen as the venue for the 2008 Plus Design Festival. Shame on me for not spotting that they had a blog though, and thanks to Nicky at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2008/10/links-for-october-10th-which-includes-a-slight-rant/">Digbeth is Good</a> for pointing it out</li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=28040414727&amp;ref=nf">Facebook group &#8211; mid*point</a><br />
&#8220;mid*point is the network for independent theatre companies in the West Midlands&#8221; There doesn&#8217;t seem to have been any activity on the website for over a year but they&#8217;ve just started a Facebook group so something must be going on under the hood</li>
