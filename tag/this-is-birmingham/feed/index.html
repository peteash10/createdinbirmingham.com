				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/jan-bowman.jpg" rel="lightbox[4419]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4420" title="jan-bowman" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/jan-bowman.jpg" alt="jan-bowman" width="500" height="331" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/jan-bowman.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/jan-bowman-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.janbow.com">Jan Bowman</a> trained as an architect and now draws pictures for a living. Her work celebrates the best of 21st-century civilisation. Originally from Scotland via Canada, she lives in England with the Old Boot and two cats</p></blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;s also the writer/illustrator of a new book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Birmingham-Glimpse-Secret-Treasures/dp/1902407938/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1259698023&amp;sr=8-1">This Is Birmingham</a> which is out on 10 December and recently earned this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/nov/13/fiction-facts-children-reading">gushing review from Shirley Dent in The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>a book very much continuing that tradition of imaginative non-fiction at its best. Stunningly illustrated it brings to glorious life the sights and sounds of Brum so familiar to my nephews. But the real genius is that it sneaks in some hardcore social and political history, starting with Birmingham&#8217;s Lunar Society and broadening out into the American, French and industrial revolutions, taking in immigration and urban development along the way. And the whole thing, my middle nephew will be pleased to learn, reads like an adventure through time and place</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s well worth visiting <a href="http://www.janbow.com/Book.html">Jan Bowman&#8217;s website</a> for a glance at some more of the pics. The book&#8217;s aimed at those of us who are aged 8+ and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Birmingham-Glimpse-Secret-Treasures/dp/1902407938/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1259698023&amp;sr=8-1">it&#8217;s only £6.99 on Amazon</a> at the moment.</p>
