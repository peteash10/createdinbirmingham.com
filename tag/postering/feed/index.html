				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is one for the promoters out there. And for anyone who gripes about not being able to find out what&#8217;s going on in this fair city (that&#8217;ll be most people then).</p>
<p><a href="http://ravonski.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/brum-promoters-i-feel-your-pain/">Ian Ravenscroft has a new blog</a> and has used is to voice his annoyance at the lack of places available for trumpeting stuff that&#8217;s happening (in his case, the <a href="http://www.popcorncomedy.com/tag/birmingham/">Popcorn Comedy nights at the Victoria</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>So realistically, we’re left with flyering and postering. Which is fine. Well, unless you live in Birmingham that is. If you’ve tried to do it here, you’ll know it’s a nightmare. You can’t flyer, you can’t poster, and subsequently promoters of all events face the prospect of shutting down due to a lack of numbers.</p>
<p>Venues don’t want to cross-promote, understandably, but as a result, it looks to the average punter like there isn’t much going on in the city. And when I say ‘average punter’ I mean, someone who likes going out, but isn’t switched on to the whole social networking/blogging/RSS thing.</p></blockquote>
