<p style="text-align: left;">Today (14th February) sees the start of <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/" target="_blank">New Art West Midlands</a> 2014. It was announced in December that 24 emerging artists from our own regional universities would exhibit their work within four different galleries across Birmingham and Wolverhampton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.tpwestmidlands.org.uk/">A Turning Point West Midlands</a> initiative, New Art West Midlands exhibits the work of 24 artists, all of whom have graduated from one of the region’s undergraduate and postgraduate fine art degree courses in the past three years: Birmingham City University, Coventry University, Staffordshire University, University of Wolverhampton and University of Worcester.  Encompassing four nationally important galleries plus five universities, it is the largest partnership of its kind in England.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Who are the Artists?</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://barber.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://barber.org.uk/our-governance/">The Barber Institute Steering Committee</a> is chaired by the University of Birmingham’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Professor Michael Whitby as well as representatives from the University’s College of Arts and Law, the Henry Barber Trust and the Friends of the Barber Institute. The Barber Institute of Fine Arts owes its existence to the vision of Dame Martha Constance Hattie Barber (1869–1933). First opened by Queen Mary in 1939, the art deco building owes its design to architect Robert Atkinson (1833-1952) and has since been a home to major art collections, a public gallery and the original concert hall for the University of Birmingham. Their collection includes paintings by Old Masters including Botticelli, Rubens, Gainsborough and Turner, as well as Impressionist and other 19th and 20th-century masterpieces by Monet, Degas, Renoir and Magritte.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Barber Institute will be exhibiting the work of Caroline Ali, James Birkin, Sade Buckle, Leah Carless, Cheryl Howard, Sikander Pervez, Glen Stoker, Wendy Ann Titmus and Chris Wright from the 14<sup>th </sup>February – 27<sup>th </sup>April. Is open from Monday – Friday between the hours of 10am – 5pm and on the weekend it is open  11am – 5pm.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://grand-union.org.uk/" target="_blank">Grand Union</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">First opened in March 2010, <a href="http://grand-union.org.uk/">Grand Union</a> is directed by Cheryl Jones. Based at 19 Minerva Works in Fazeley, Grand Union is an exciting artist-led project space that houses 8 purpose built studios (and they really are lovely!) which were designed by designer Matthew Higginbottom with <a href="http://queenandcrawford.com/" target="_blank">Queen &amp; Crawford</a>. As well as exhibiting the works from the Turning Point West Midlands artists, Grand Union will also be hosting a talk on the <a href="http://grand-union.org.uk/gallery/artists-talk-new-art-west-midlands-2014/" target="_blank">17<sup>th</sup> February</a> from 6:30pm till 8:00pm featuring artists Leah Carless, Sarah Sehra, Anna Smith, Glen Stoker and Hannah Sutherland.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery</a> opened on 28th November 1885. Birmingham’s citizens had campaigned for a Corporation Art Gallery for over 40 years. The generosity of manufacturers such as Thomas Clarkson Osler, Richard and George Tangye, and Mayors Joseph and Richard Chamberlain, secured the art gallery for the town. Now funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and Birmingham City Council it now boasts over 500,000 objects to make up the numerous collections that originate from each of the continents and dating from 200,000 years ago to the modern day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Having recently held the successful Photorealism Exhibition (still open until 30<sup>th</sup> March) they will be exhibiting the Turning Point West Midland’s Artists from the 14<sup>th</sup> February – 18<sup>th</sup> May.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">BMAG will be exhibiting the work of Gregory Dunn, James Birkin, Csilla Farkas, Anna Horton, Cheryl Howard, Lucy Hutchinson, Lockie-Anrig, Santhanha Nguyen, Sikander Pervez, Ali Reed, Anna Smith, Hannah Sutherland and Barbara Witkowska. Opening times are between 10am – 5pm all week apart from Friday when they open a little later, 10.30am – 5pm.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/" target="_blank">Wolverhampton Art Gallery</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/">WAVE</a> is a collection of buildings.

Wolverhampton Art Gallery has a range of collections and regularly exhibits new works, including contemporary pieces as well as grand paintings dating back as far as the 18<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not only is Wolverhampton Art Gallery a great resource for artworks, they are also involved with their community, regularly running events and workshops that are open to the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wolverhampton Art Gallery is open from Monday – Saturday between the hours of 10am – 5pm. They will be exhibiting the work of Sade Buckle, Sharon Farrelly, Amelia Greville, Emily Mulenga, Sarah Sehra, Anna Smith and Wendy Ann Titmus.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-a.jpg" rel="lightbox[17032]"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17085" alt="off key a" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-a-610x409.jpg" width="610" height="409" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-a-610x409.jpg 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-a-300x201.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-a.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>Upon entering <a href="https://www.facebook.com/offkeytattoostudio" target="_blank">OFF KEY Studio</a>, you are not confronted with any skin. This place is about the drawings; the sketches, the design style, the colour rendering, examples of the artists’ work adorning the walls.</p>
<p>There’s an air of calm, with space to breathe and walls covered with inspiring examples of established tattoo artists. Forget intimidating &#8211; you could be forgiven for wanting to hang out there.</p>
<p>I learn from talking to Craig, the owner of OFF KEY Studio, all tattoos produced there are custom-made and designed by the tattooists. The evidence of designs; tracings ready to be copied, stencilled and inked, are a reassuring note that these are works awaiting a next canvas.</p>
<p><span id="more-17032"></span></p>
<p>OFF KEY was established in 2011, at first as a clothing line working alongside other brands, tattooists and designers. Craig, a local lad, set his mind to opening the Jewellery Quarter based studio, with his belief that the skills needed for tattooing, and the tattoos themselves, are the best form of art “you keep with you”. OFF KEY Studio followed in December 2012.</p>
<p>The studio is tucked between Birmingham City University School of Jewellery and an industrial tool shop. A subtle A-frame and hanging sign sit outside the red door. Head upstairs to a space where light floods in through the casement windows from both sides.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b.jpg" rel="lightbox[17032]"><img class="size-full wp-image-17088 aligncenter" alt="off key b" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b.jpg" width="430" height="640" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b.jpg 430w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>They produce mainly traditional tattoos with real artistic talent. Each of the two current resident tattooists &#8211; Max (explosions of intricate colour blocking, neo-traditional) and Rob (darker, detailed black work, without colour) &#8211; have a distinct style.</p>
<p>OFF KEY Studio is about art, respect, reputation. It is about dedication, commitment and finding that perfect (next) tattoo. With people often travelling miles to get a tattoo by an artist they respect, Craig thinks Birmingham is as good as anywhere location-wise, as it’s more about the person and reputation than the location. With guest artists on occasion coming to OFF KEY Studio, local people also get access to an artist who could be based anywhere in the country.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c.jpg" rel="lightbox[17032]"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17086" alt="off key c" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c-610x427.jpg" width="610" height="427" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c-610x427.jpg 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>Next step for the studio is finding the perfect third artist to complement the skills and styles of the current two residents. Reputation and quality paramount, Craig knows he has a challenge to find someone that can match current standards. Having been around the scene for many years, apprenticing, training, working, gaining licences and meeting the standards needed for the impeccable studio, there will need to be someone out there with the same level of dedication.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of collecting your next tattoo, have a look on Instagram at the styles of the two artists, get an idea of what you want, head along and talk it through.</span></p>

<p>Art certainly doesn’t have to hang on walls.</p>

<p><a href="http://ortcafe.co.uk/">Ort Café&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/themagiccinema">The Magic Cinema</a> is back, and looking for local short films. In their own words, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/themagiccinema">The Magic Cinema</a> is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A Birmingham based micro-cinema featuring an &#8220;open reel&#8221; section (bring your film along and we&#8217;ll show it, as long as it&#8217;s under 15 minutes), and a selection of underground/no-budget/obscure/DIY/outsider etc. films from further afield.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ortcafe.co.uk/">Ort</a> is one of those magical unique places outside of the city centre &#8211; in Balsall Heath to be precise, and well worth a venture. I was there on Friday night watching some what can only be described as mesmerising <em>far out</em> jazz.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://ortcafe.co.uk/">Ort&#8217;s</a> full list of events, including language lessons, quizzes, art exhibitions, workshops, screenings and much much more, <a href="http://ortcafe.co.uk/?page_id=304">best see their website</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">They are hosting a private view on Friday 16th November from 6-9pm, where you can meet the artists, watch a musical performance by artists Andy Smith and Shaun Morris (composed in response to the exhibition) and see local band Box Of Knives. The Works is quite a mystery to me (and it doesn&#8217;t have a website) but for a bit more information about the exhibition, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IndigoOctagon">check Indigo Octagon&#8217;s facebook for updates</a>. It&#8217;s good to see new and unusual things cropping up, and I quite like the raw unpolished/fanzine-esque style of their <a href="http://issuu.com/indigooctagon/docs/indigooctagon1">exhibition programme</a>.</p>
