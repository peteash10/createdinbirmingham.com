				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iain Grant, writer and editor of <a title="PPP" href="http://pigeonparkpress.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pigeon Park Press</a>, is calling for expression of interest from writers for their new project Ten to One and you have until March 31st to get in touch with a sample of your work and a brief writing bio.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14683" alt="Ten To One" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53-248x300.png" width="248" height="300" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53-248x300.png 248w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53.png 648w" sizes="(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px" /></p>
<p>So, what is Ten to One?</p>
<blockquote><p>Ten To One is a collaborative writing project. Ten writers will work together to produce a novel-length piece of fiction which will then by published by Pigeon Park Press. Each writer will handle one of ten central characters and write the chapters focussing on that character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The most exciting, and unique, feature of this project is that after each writer has written one chapter one of the characters will be kicked out of the story. The character that is kicked out is decided by both a panel of judges, this will be three individuals who are known and respected in the writing world and will change as the project moves on, and a public vote. At the end of the novel there will be one character left from the initial ten; Ten To One.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans for what genre Ten To One will be, making it a blank page for the differing styles and ideas of each writer to develop together into one story.</p>
<p>Contact details and further information about this project can be found <a title="PPP" href="http://pigeonparkpress.blogspot.co.uk/p/ten-to-one-collaboratively-written.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Iain is keen for anyone with questions to contact him to discuss the project further. There is also a <a title="TenToOneFacebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/TenToOneNovel" target="_blank">Ten To One</a> Facebook page and <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/TenToOneNovel" target="_blank">Twitter</a> page.</p>
<p>So writers, what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>Do you like to push your writing to the extreme? Well next Saturday at Grand Union you will have the chance to push your pen wielding fingers to their very extreme with a 12 hour, all night writing extravaganza.</p>
<p>&#8216;Part 12-hour exam, part club night, part endurance writing event&#8217;, the organisers <a href="http://www.birminghamartzine.com/birmingham_art_zine/1.html">BAZ</a> and Hooky Street Press welcome all those who cross the path of the location to take part and give their unique responses to the proposed subjects. A little more info:</p>
<div id="id1">
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Writing produced during the event will be collated into a print on demand publication which all participants will receive a free copy of. </strong></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="id3">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Participants should bring a laptop, sleeping bag, biro and a digital version of an up to date CV and biography. DJ facilities will also be present, so bring any records you would like to play.  </strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Energy focused beverages and food will be available throughout the night; a free fry-up will also be provided as reward for the 12 hours of fictitious proposal writing.</strong></em></p>
<p> It should be an interesting event, even though I am still a little puzzled by what it actually is, but it is certainly something very different and looking to be challenging in both art and physical stamina of your fingers.</p>
<p>Full event details: <strong>Friday August 31st 8.00 pm &#8211; Saturday September 1st 8.00 am /<a title="http://www.grand-union.org.uk/" href="http://www.grand-union.org.uk/">Grand Union</a>, Central Digside, B5 5RS</strong></p>
