<p>Do you like to push your writing to the extreme? Well next Saturday at Grand Union you will have the chance to push your pen wielding fingers to their very extreme with a 12 hour, all night writing extravaganza.</p>
<p>&#8216;Part 12-hour exam, part club night, part endurance writing event&#8217;, the organisers <a href="http://www.birminghamartzine.com/birmingham_art_zine/1.html">BAZ</a> and Hooky Street Press welcome all those who cross the path of the location to take part and give their unique responses to the proposed subjects. A little more info:</p>
<div id="id1">
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Writing produced during the event will be collated into a print on demand publication which all participants will receive a free copy of. </strong></em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="id3">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Participants should bring a laptop, sleeping bag, biro and a digital version of an up to date CV and biography. DJ facilities will also be present, so bring any records you would like to play.  </strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Energy focused beverages and food will be available throughout the night; a free fry-up will also be provided as reward for the 12 hours of fictitious proposal writing.</strong></em></p>
<p> It should be an interesting event, even though I am still a little puzzled by what it actually is, but it is certainly something very different and looking to be challenging in both art and physical stamina of your fingers.</p>
<p>Full event details: <strong>Friday August 31st 8.00 pm &#8211; Saturday September 1st 8.00 am /<a title="http://www.grand-union.org.uk/" href="http://www.grand-union.org.uk/">Grand Union</a>, Central Digside, B5 5RS</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In no particular order…</p>
<p>Getting to wander around Curzon Street Station (although there&#8217;s some good stuff in there, I have to admit I was excited enough about the building itself), finally making it over to <a title="The Lombard Method" href="http://www.thelombardmethod.org/">The Lombard Method</a>, <a href="http://grand-union.co.uk/wp/2011/direct-from-this-window-117%C2%BA-south-east-a-view-from-the-bosphorus/">Simon Faithfull&#8217;s window piece</a> at Grand Union, meeting the guys behind BAZ (and <a href="http://athleticotorturedartistsfc.tumblr.com/">Athletico Tortured Artists</a>), <a title="Crowd 6" href="http://crowd6.org.uk/">Crowd 6</a>&#8216;s exhibition and all sorts of other bits and pieces.</p>
<p>Not that it was all my cup of tea, necessarily, but then that&#8217;s all part of the fun too. <a href="http://curatorcharlie.blogspot.com/2011/10/few-others-at-event.html">Charlie Levine&#8217;s written a post of her own</a> about what&#8217;s going on &#8211; she&#8217;s got pictures.</p>
<p><a title="The Event" href="http://the-event.org/">The Event</a> is on until 30 October. If you don&#8217;t know your way round (and even if you do) it&#8217;s worth joining one of the <a href="http://the-event.org/blog/public-tours-2/">guided tours</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Behna (Sisters)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This unique and intimate theatre production by <a href="http://www.kalitheatre.co.uk/">Kali Theatre</a> will be performed in the kitchens of Punjabi households across the Black Country from 22 March to 15 April.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the day before a wedding, Ladies&#8217; Sangeet Night, in a Punjabi household. The bride is having her henna done and the guests are busy eating, singing and dancing. But in the kitchen, sibling jealousy simmers alongside the samosas.  Fast-paced, funny and moving, Behna takes a look through the keyhole of a family house to reveal the secrets and lies of two generations of sisters.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>One, Nineteen</strong></p>
<p>One, Nineteen from local ‘Archers’ writer, Tim Stimpson, is on at <a href="http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk/">The Old Joint Stock Theatre</a> on 18 &amp; 19 March.</p>
<blockquote><p>19th January: Freak storms bring devastating floods to the English coast, but before the rescue effort arrives, the media are already in town spinning their story. A play about the power of the news, the strength of the government, the question of climate change, and of course, and the search for Sam, Jack and little Chloe&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>After premiering in London, it was given a 4 star review from Time Out, so it&#8217;s probably worth a watch.</p>

<p>In the last of <a href="http://www.grand-union.org.uk/">Grand Union</a>&#8216;s Live Acts and Sound programme, artist duos <a href="http://www.chrisandkeir.com/">chris+keir</a> and <a href="http://melvillemitchell.co.uk/">Melville Mitchell</a> will present an evening of live, alternating performance challenges on Fri 25 February.</p>
<p>The duos both use &#8216;forced performance&#8217; as a working method, meaning their performances go off structures, tasks, systems, rules, formulas and instructions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;What performs? Air fresheners, roofing insulation,  bicycles, carpets and rugs, powerboats, wallcoverings, drain panels,  cleansing towels, car-stereo equipment, bakeware, aquarium filters,  tires, fabric, window film, woodworking knives, automotive timing  chains, foil containers, audio antennae, deep fat fryers, embossing  tools, mop handles, music synthesizers, casement windows&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Jon Mckenzie, Perform Or Else (2001)</p>
<p>Through a combination of classic performance work, formulaic jokes and wooden contraptions, chris+keir will be searching for a punchline to <em>&#8216;What is the difference between Bruce Nauman&#8217;s Walking in an Exaggerated  Manner Around the Perimeter of a Square and Monty Python&#8217;s The Ministry  of Silly Walks?</em>&#8216;</p>
<p>Melville Mitchel on the other hand, will be utilising the paraphernalia of British drinking culture, by undertaking a series of formidable tasks which place them in both conflict and coalition, together with a set of complex rules encouraging a unified thirst toward a common goal.</p>
<p>Doors open at 7.30pm, performance starts at 8pm</p>
