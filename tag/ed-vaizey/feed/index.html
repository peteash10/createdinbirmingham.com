				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/ministers_speeches/8853.aspx">keynote speech at the State of the Arts conference</a> in Manchester last week, in a list of notable cultural things happening this year, Ed Vaizey included:</p>
<blockquote><p>an epic new choral work from composer Jonathan Harvey to be performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</p></blockquote>
<p>Which was a coincidence because, only a few days before, the person behind the <a title="Think Walsall on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/thinkwalsall">@thinkwalsall</a> Twitter account mentioned to me that Jonathan Harvey is from Sutton Coldfield.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d not heard of Jonathan Harvey before but I did some quick digging around and here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vivosvoco.com/">his website</a> and <a title="Jonathan Harvey - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Harvey_(composer)">his Wikipedia page</a>. Very recently the BBC put on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/events/567">a weekend of music, film and discussion celebrating his music</a> at the Barbican.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like a listen to some of his work, here&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fne0ICEsJA" title="Jonathan Harvey - Madonna for Winter and Spring">Madonna of Winter and Spring</a>&#8221; for orchestra, synthesizers and live electronics, from 1986.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I went to the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/10/12/something-about-a-creative-city/">previously-mentioned</a> <strong>Birmingham Creative City</strong> launch at lunchtime.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d still struggle to explain exactly what it <em>is</em>, so here&#8217;s some blurb from the <a href="http://birminghamnewsroom.com/2011/10/culture-minister-launches-birmingham-creative-city-initiative/">council&#8217;s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Creative City initiative will play a significant role by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a fund to build on existing public sector funding of the arts through loans, grants, match-funding and investments. The allocation of funds will be based on the potential for job creation and economic growth.</li>
<li>Outlining the vision for a new ‘museum quarter’, including a new museum of photography and the development of a new contemporary art gallery.</li>
<li>Exploring ways to unlock private sector and philanthropic support for culture, linking cultural development to wider economic growth.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So this was really the launch of an idea. In the way that Manchester has <a href="http://www.mediacityuk.co.uk/">Media City</a> and London has <a href="http://www.techcityuk.com/">Tech City</a>, Birmingham (if it wants it) could claim the title of Creative City.</p>
<p>Thing is, the designations of those other two seem to have been built on much stronger foundations (a strong BBC presence and an already burgeoning tech scene, respectively). All we seem to have at the moment is ideas, visions (like <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B3OX4ags5zyuMmM3YmFhYjItZDFkYi00YTg5LTgzNmEtZmZjZjcwY2QxZTM1&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1">this one for a Museum Quarter</a>), pledges and plans with comparatively little substance. Maybe&#8217;s it&#8217;s just early days, but if the intention of this event was to make people excited about the possibilities on offer then I don&#8217;t think it worked.</p>
<p>Maybe the more substantial conversations are all taking place behind closed doors this afternoon &#8211; but then I got the sense from others that therein lies the problem. Chatting to people afterwards actually left me kinda depressed by it all.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m not sure what to make of it and I&#8217;m pretty busy, so <a href="http://soundcloud.com/chrisunitt/sets/birmingham-creative-city">here&#8217;s the audio from the speeches</a> that were made. Please have a listen (they&#8217;re all quite short) and I&#8217;d love to hear what you make of this in the comments below.</p>
<p><object width="100%" height="205" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1234819" /><embed width="100%" height="205" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1234819" allowscriptaccess="always" /></object></p>
<p>In typical <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDKQliH1awY">Peter O&#8217;Hanra-Hanrahan</a> style, I managed to miss the bit where James Yarker from <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> thanked Cllr Timothy Huxtable for name-checking his theatre company but asked him how he squared that with the council cutting their funding by 100%. The response is in the final audio clip above (although it does make for uncomfortable listening).</p>
<p><strong>On the subject</strong></p>
<p>It would be hugely remiss of me not to point out <a href="http://iam.peteashton.com/birmingham-will-break-your-art/">this rather angry post by Pete Ashton</a>, many of the sentiments of which I would endorse.</p>
<p><strong>A couple more links</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1867">This from James at Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> should be read</li>
<li>As should <a href="http://stef.io/2011/10/some-thoughts-about-birmingham-creative-city">this from Stef Lewandowski</a>, should be read too, with some interesting comments</li>
<li><a href="http://philipparkin.com/2011/10/26/birmingham-creative-city/">Philip Parkin is upbeat but says</a> he &#8220;struggled to find the substance&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://bopconsulting.typepad.com/bop-consultings-culture/2011/10/birmingham-the-creative-city.html">BOP Consulting point out</a> this launch is all &#8220;particularly interesting as it is one of the first LEPs to announce its ambitions for the creative industries&#8217;</li>
<li><a href="http://iam.peteashton.com/creative-city-fallout/">Pete&#8217;s done a round-up of some of the discussion</a></li>
<li>Pete also pointed to <a href="http://www.restirred.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=1886">the discussion on the Re-Stirred forum</a></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Conservative Party Conference starts tomorrow, so expect a fair amount of disruption around the city centre &#8211; especially the city end of Broad Street around the ICC and Symphony Hall.</p>
<p>Travel advice aside, arts and culture will be getting a foot in the door a few times over the duration, including this lot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jonathan Watkins (Director of <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/">Ikon Gallery</a>) has been invited by <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/jeremy_hunt/south_west_surrey">Jeremy Hunt MP</a> to speak on Sunday. His speech will apparently &#8220;highlight the cultural wealth of Birmingham and promote Ikon&#8217;s ambition for the creation of a new museum of modern art in the city&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/">Screen WM</a> are putting on a fringe event called <a href="http://cityasaplatform.eventbrite.com/">City as a Platform</a> (reminiscent of the much-referenced, lesser read <a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2008/02/the-street-as-p.html">Dan Hill post</a>) on Monday</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/edward_vaizey/wantage">Ed Vaizey MP</a> will be off and about on Monday. He&#8217;ll be officially opening <a href="http://www.zellig.co.uk/">Zellig</a> and later on checking out <a href="http://www.skillset.org/uk/westmids/further/article_4923_1.asp">BCU&#8217;s Skillset Media Academy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk/">Rosie Kay Dance Company</a> will be <a href="http://www.dance-ground.com/2010/09/scoring-points-for-style-at.html">performing Double Points: K</a> at the Symphony Hall on Tuesday</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more happening too, but those are the ones I&#8217;ve come across.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been invited, with a bunch of other local bloggers, to go and meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeeda_Warsi,_Baroness_Warsi">Sayeeda Warsi</a> (Co-Chairman of the Conservative Party and Cabinet Minister without portfolio) and <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/andrew_mitchell/sutton_coldfield">Andrew Mitchell</a> (MP for Sutton Coldfield and Secretary of State for International Development) later today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 6.30pm today I&#8217;m running a liveblog for <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a> at a debate that will look at <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/news/2010/04/20/the-election-debate-live/">the future of public investment in the arts</a>. The Hippodrome are hosting and these are the panelists:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/edward_vaizey/wantage">Ed Vaizey</a> (Conservative)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/sion_simon/birmingham%2C_erdington">Siôn Simon</a> (Labour)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/lord_clement-jones">Lord Clement-Jones</a> (Lib Dem)</li>
<li>Marc Reeves (<a href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/">TheBusinessDesk.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Journalist, broadcaster and author, <a href="http://www.rosiemillard.com/">Rosie Millard</a> will chair the debate.</p>
<p>The politicians on the panel are, or have until recently been, party spokespeople for arts  and culture. Marc Reeves has recently <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/6569.aspx">advised DCMS</a> on new models of independent news provision. They&#8217;re all busy people at the moment so pinning them down can&#8217;t have been easy.</p>
<p>What would you want to see them asked? How far spending cuts are going to go? Whether encouraging philanthropy is going to help anyone other than large venues? What the heck they were thinking with the Digital Economy Act? </p>
<p>You can watch follow the debate on CiB below and chip in with any thoughts or comments as we go along. The liveblog has <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com/Event/Dancing_on_Thin_Ice">a page of its own here</a> too.</p>
