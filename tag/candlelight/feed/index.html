<p>Last weekend I went along to <a title="Aston Hall by candlelight" href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/events?id=1552">Aston Hall</a> for one of the candlelit tours they do at this time of year:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the country’s finest Jacobean houses, Aston Hall is seen at its most breathtaking, lit by around 300 shimmering candles and warmed by two glorious historic fireplaces</p></blockquote>
<p>It was pretty good too. It&#8217;s an amazing place and some of the actors that were dotted around were clearly having a lot of fun (especially one of the sword fighters at the beginning). I hadn&#8217;t realised what a big deal it was either &#8211; there were a lot of people booked in for each tour.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t make it along this year than apparently you&#8217;ll have to wait until 2013 for the next one. In the meantime, <a title="Video of Aston Hall by candlelight on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QB4u9I_0bU">here&#8217;s a video</a>:</p>
