<p>After being independently published, Birmingham writer <a href="http://charliemachill.weebly.com/index.html">Charlie Hill&#8217;s</a> first novel &#8216;The Space Between Things&#8217; is set in Moseley and looks at the free party people and road  protesters of the early 1990&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Fellow Birmingham author,  Jim Crace, described his writing as &#8216;intelligent and witty&#8217;. Jonathan Coe also gave praise for the book;</p>
<blockquote><p>What I liked very much about the novel  was that it vividly captures a moment in Britain&#8217;s recent past, and  takes us inside a world and a milieu which most readers won&#8217;t have known  before. And of course, as a tragic love story, it packs a considerable  punch.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book will be out 1 October, along with a launch event on 14 October at Waterstones&#8217; Birmingham High  Street branch.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Space Between Things&#8217; can be pre-ordered from Amazon, Waterstones and London Review Bookshop, but you&#8217;d like a head start, Charlie has posted the <a href="http://charliemachill.weebly.com/read-the-first-chapter.html">first chapter online</a>.</p>

<p>A book written and published independently by local writer Matt Wilding.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tristan Marley is a  drunk. He is dishonest, work-shy, selfish and a murderer of kittens. He has no self respect, failed dreams, and feels as though the world, which is crueler  to he than any other man, owes him one.</p>
<p>Forced to take up  menial employment, and instantly despising it,  Tristan concocts a devilish  scheme to secure the big pay day that he  undeniably deserves. Chewed up, and  spat out, Tristan is left at the brink of his own sanity, maimed and drowning  in a constant supply of  whiskey, when a chance encounter with a magpie changes  everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you like the sound of that, you can <a href="http://www.magpiepress.co.uk/Sample_Chapter_One.pdf">read the opening chapter</a> in full and <a href="http://www.magpiepress.co.uk/shop.html">buy the book</a> over at Magpie Press.</p>
<p>The lovely cover art has been designed by local illustrator, Charlotte Audrey Owen-Meehan, who also curated the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/04/22/not-my-type/">Not My Type exhibition</a> which you&#8217;ll probably remember from the CiB Shop.</p>
