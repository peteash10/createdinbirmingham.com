				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">So how many of you were awake at <a href="http://4amproject.org/2009/04/4am-on-4th-april/" target="_blank">4am on the 04/04/09</a>?  And how many of you visually documented that moment?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="well if i can get out of bed..." src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/3411785132_ee9be97c7e.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As was <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/04/07/4am-project/" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a> here on CiB, the <a href="http://4amproject.org/" target="_blank">4am Project</a> is the genius concept of <a href="http://www.karenstrunks.com/" target="_blank">Karen Strunks</a>, a Birmingham photographer who singlehandedly convinced thousands of strangers across the world that it would be a <em>great</em> idea to stay awake/get up at 4am to document that moment for no other reason than to be part of a larger group of people doing just that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And people, in their droves, agreed that it was a great idea and stayed up (or set their alarms, like me!) and took photographs and sent them to the 4am website, or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/4amproject" target="_blank">tagged them on Flickr</a> so that everyone could see a snapshot of the world, of <em>their</em> world, at such an uncomfortably late/early hour.  Who knew you could create such extensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital" target="_blank">social capital</a> before breakfast?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36065798@N03/3619831921/"><img class="aligncenter" title="4ammap" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2428/3619831921_ec80b89112.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="244" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building upon the success of the previous event, 4am photos have continued to flood in, without being prompted to do so &#8211; and Karen has now decided it&#8217;s time to coordinate another 4am en masse.  The date of the next event is: <strong>21/06/09</strong>.  (And in case you somehow missed it, the time will be 4am, and the place will be wherever you are!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the 4am Project has been nominated for the <a href="http://digitalpressawards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Digital Press Awards</a>, and if you think (like I do) that this project is a fab idea and a lot of fun, then vote for it to win!</p>
