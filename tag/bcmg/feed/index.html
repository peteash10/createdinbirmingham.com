				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/news.php?id=2047">Via BCMG&#8217;s news section</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Birmingham City Council has launched a Public Consultation on its Budget Plans from April 2012. Please support the cultural life of the city by taking part in this. The official deadline for responses is 8 January, <strong>however</strong> we urge responses<strong> by the end of November</strong>, as they can then feed in to the Council Cabinet’s decisions on arts spending in early December</p></blockquote>
<p>A public consultation might not be very exciting, but if you want this city to support culture and creativity then it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to mention that to the people who make the decisions &#8211; they&#8217;re not psychic, y&#8217;know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a classical musician, I have often found that contemporary music is met with extreme unnecessary prejudice from most audiences, and even from the musicians themselves. However, we have come a long way since Arnold Schoenberg and his band of merry Serialist pranksters.</p>
<p>We are lucky to live in city so diverse that there is music and art of all types so readily available to us. In the music scene, some artists aren&#8217;t just available, they are begging for audiences to experience their music. I have sourced some excellent music that is being performed in Birmingham in the next month, alone. This is just a tiny snapshot into the world of music and performance that is not achieving quite the audience members that it rightly deserves.</p>
<p>With the news of the cuts happening in the next few years in Birmingham, it is now that we should be celebrating what we, as artists, have to offer. The best way, I feel, to do this, is to see everything. Go to concerts and experience what has been provided to us, show the people in charge of money in this city what, we, as music fans need.</p>
<p><strong>Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical, dance, technology</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the the CBSO&#8217;s (City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra) biggest projects of the 2010/2011 is it&#8217;s performance of Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Rite of Spring</em>. A formidable and excellent piece in it&#8217;s own right, the creators at the CBSO and Symphony Hall have fused together music, dance and technology :</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience an astonishing interplay between reality and fantasy as dancer Julia Mach’s extraordinary live performance interacts, through the magic of digital wizardry, with real-time, computer generated stereoscopic projections, translated into a virtual reality space with the aid of 3D spectacles for the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; THSH</p>
<p>The 30-minutes piece is preceded by Varese&#8217;s <em>Tuning Up</em> and Ligeti&#8217;s <em>Lontano</em> for large orchestra, a distant and warm piece which plays with with the make-up of unconventional diatonic harmony.</p>
<p>For more info and for the special Rite of Spring micro-site, please visit <a href="http://riteofspring3d.thsh.co.uk/">http://riteofspring3d.thsh.co.uk</a></p>
<p><strong>Birmingham Contemporary Music Group &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>The BCMG is the city&#8217;s orchestra dedicated entirely to the performance of contemporary and new music. Made up of players from the CBSO, the flexible organisation has grown in the one of the world&#8217;s most fore-thinking ensembles of new music. They play regular concerts at the CBSO Centre on Berkley Street, B1, as well as touring all over the city.</p>
<p>The percussion players are performing what promises to be an excellent concert of Varese and Xenakis on the 25th March at Yardley Old Church as well as this Sunday (13th March).</p>
<p>Oliver Knussen conducts his own memorial work <em>Requiem &#8211; Songs for Sue</em> as well as pieces by Morton Feldman and Harrison Birtwistle</p>
<p><strong>Steve Reich and Thomas Ades. &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>This week, Friday 11th March, Symphony Hall have also included another excellent performance of contemporary. The London Sinfonietta, one of the world&#8217;s leading orchestra for contemporary classical music are visiting Birmingham, performing Steve<br />
Reich&#8217;s <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em>, complete with 4 grand pianos and 5 marimbas. The minimalist style of Steve Reich is used in many sources of media, films, adverts and television, purely for the fact it is accessible to both musician and audience alike. Conductor Thomas Ades? starts the concert with his own In Seven Days, a collaborative project with filmmaker Tal Rosner and is based on the Creation.</p>
<p>Tickets start from £10 (or £5 on the day for U25s)</p>
<p><strong>The Irrepressibles: Mirror Mirror<em> &#8211; contemporary pop, performance art, collaboration, crossover</em></strong></p>
<p>Another gig at the heart of Birmingham, the Town Hall, <em>The Irrepressibles</em> are a 10-piece orchestra committed to stretching the boundaries of conventional performance. Lead by singer, Jamie McDermot, they perform hearty indie music with a set up of orchestral musicians as accompaniment.</p>
<p>This show is in conjunction with Fierce Festival and is at Town Hall, 22nd March, £15</p>
<p><strong>SOUNDkitchen &#8211; <em>contemporary, sound, experimental, collaboration</em></strong></p>
<p>SOUNDkitchen is a new group made up of music graduates from the University of Birmingham. Their “STONEsoup” concert at the MAC was met with rave reviews and are following up with a collaborative event with Balkanic Eruption, promoters of Klezmer and Balkan music within the city. Playing at the Hare and Hounds, B14, the concert focuses on expanding sound using technology and live instruments, it will be followed by a live laptop performance from Garfield Benjamin.</p>
<p><a href="http://soundkitchenuk.org/500/balkan-fusion-hare-and-hounds"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9360" title="SOUNDkitchen" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KITCHEN_CT3-724x1024.jpg" alt="" width="415" height="587" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KITCHEN_CT3-724x1024.jpg 724w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KITCHEN_CT3-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Birmingham Conservatoire &#8211; <em>classical contemporary, premieres, fusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Like the Uni of Birmingham, the Conservatoire has one of the most developed composition departments in the country. The students are exceptionally talented and lucky for us the concerts are generally very cheap and on a regular basis. This month as well as a student showcase of new music (held on the 18th March and conducted by the great Edwin Roxburgh) we see the <em>Frontiers</em> department of Conservatoire play host to world-renowned electronic violinist, Barbara Luneberg. This young talent has worked with some of the world&#8217;s best contemporary composers. On the 14th March, Luneberg is to perform works written for her by young composers from all over Europe, this will also include a premiere of work by VT of the Conservatoire, Ed Bennett.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk">Birmingham Contemporary Music Group</a> launch their 2010/11 season on 10 October with a double focus. <a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=205">The concert</a> will feature new work by composer Simon Holt, along with the talents of pianist Rolf Hind and soprano Sarah Leonard, plus work by hugely influential German composer Helmut Lachenmann.</p>
<blockquote><p>Simon Holt’s complex, dramatic music was first performed by BCMG in 1990 and it has rarely been out of the ensemble’s repertoire. Twenty years on, BCMG presents another Holt premiere.  <em>A Knot of Time</em>, conducted by <strong>Richard Baker</strong>, is the composer’s setting of five poems by Federico García Lorca – the Andalucian poet whose dark, passionate and enigmatic texts have much in common with Holt&#8217;s own sound world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the <a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=205">Season Launch Concert</a>, there are whole string of concerts filling the BCMG diary through until Summer 2011. The programme until the end of 2010 looks like this;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=206">BEAST: States of Play</a> &#8211; 16 &amp; 17 October. Presenting another weekend of electro-acoustic sound, using this spectacular multichannel diffusion system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=137">Feel the Buzz</a> &#8211; 24 &amp; 31 October. A free  composing workshops for 14 to 18 year olds held at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=208">Families@5 conducted by Oliver Knussen</a> &#8211; 14 November. A bite-sized interactive concert for young people and families, exploring energetic and jazz-influenced music.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=207">Mark-Anthony Turnage 50th Birthday Concert</a> &#8211; 14 November. A celebration of the composer&#8217;s work, with pre-concert talk Mark-Anthony Turnage and Charlotte Bray, open to all ticket holders.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?showid=209">BCMG conducted by Peter Rundel</a> &#8211; 5 December. This high-octane mid-afternoon concert features works from two established younger composers – Tansy Davies and Enno Poppe.</p>
<p>Tickets for all of the above can be bought <a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/diary.php?id=302">online</a> or by calling the box office on <strong>0121 767 4050</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As threatened previously, I did  pop over to Ikon Eastside on Friday lunchtime. The current installation is by <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/339/ryoji_ikeda/">Ryoji Ikeda and is called <em>data.tron</em></a>, part of:</p>
<blockquote><p>his exploration of the infinity of data between 0 and 1, an abstraction of reality that challenges our perception of the codes present in everyday life</p></blockquote>
<p>It was quite nice and sunny on Friday afternoon, so stepping off Fazeley Street and walking straight into a pitch black space was a little disconcerting. Especially with no-one else around, the air filled with a high-pitched whine and clicking with the large wall at the far end taken up by a projection of streaming data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg" rel="lightbox[3984]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3985" title="Ryoji Ikeda" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg" alt="Ryoji Ikeda" width="450" height="300" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda.jpg 450w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ryoji-Ikeda-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>For a second it all felt a little too Poltergeist/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28film%29">Ring</a>-esque &#8211; I half expected Sadako to start crawling towards me. That didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>What looked like white noise from a distance turned out to be precisely determined; calculated data with it&#8217;s own, very particular, order (albeit one I couldn&#8217;t make out &#8211; but I&#8217;m happy to accept it&#8217;s there). Interesting, then.</p>
<p><em>data.tron</em> will be at Ikon Eastside until 8 November, while on 24 November there&#8217;ll be an audio-visual concert &#8211; <em><a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/348/datamatics_ver20/">datamatics [ver 2.0]</a></em> &#8211; by Ryoji Ikeda at the CBSO Centre, hosted by <a href="http://www.bcmg.org.uk/">BCMG</a>.</p>
<p>The work will also form the backdrop of <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/352/onoff/">Ikon Eastside&#8217;s closing party</a> on 12 November:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dress code is black and white, lights and atmosphere will be suitably monochrome, music and bands organised in collaboration with <a href="http://wearecolour.com/">Colour</a></p></blockquote>
