				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was agonising about how much I can say about this without giving too much away (given police intervention with recent Birmingham flash mobs) but I&#8217;ve just noticed all the info&#8217;s now up on the <a href="http://www.b-vac.com/2008/08/flash-mob-art/">B-VAC blog</a> anyway, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Saturday 16 August, members of the <a href="http://www.b-vac.com/">Birmingham Visual Arts Coalition</a> will be exhibiting pieces of their art to an unsuspecting public:</p>
<blockquote><p>These â€˜exhibitionsâ€™ will last for a very short period of time (ie. a matter of minutes) and if the public choose to view or ignore it they do so at their own discretion.Â  They will appear to be completely random and the members of B-VAC will not make themselves known to the audience until the point at which the exhibition begins.</p></blockquote>
<p>This will happen between 1-2pm and the list of venues (in no particular order) is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oozells Square &#8211; along the diagonal drain</li>
<li>outside Bullring &#8211; by the Bull</li>
<li>Centenary Square &#8211; by the fountain</li>
<li>somewhere in the St. Phillipâ€™s grounds</li>
<li>Victoria Square &#8211; around the Andrew Gormley</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.b-vac.com/">B-VAC website</a> for more info.</p>
