<p>I&#8217;m not usually one to pander to titles with an obscure mix of upper- and lower-case letters in them, but for this I&#8217;ll make an exception.</p>
<p><a href="http://eastsideprojects.org/index.php?/future/hobbypopmuseum/">hobbypopMUSEUM</a> is a new solo exhibition at <a href="http://eastsideprojects.org">Eastside Projects</a> by the Düsseldorf- and London-based artist group of the same name formed by Sophie von Hellermann, Christian Jendreiko,  Matthias Lahme, Dietmar Lutz, André Niebur and Marie-Céline Schäfer in 1998.</p>
<p>As a group  they have created potent site-specific installations, fusing  painting  with sound, performance and film. Here&#8217;s some more on them:</p>
<blockquote><p>hobbypopMUSEUM installations can be seen as textures woven out of figures  linked together by iconographic and formal criteria. Their arsenal of  figures spans histories of painting, drawing, photo, film and sound to  words, performance, sculpture and architecture. Which form the figures  take, depends on a basic confrontation with the conditions of site and  chemistry of the group.</p>
<p>Eschewing the socio-political agenda typically associated with  collective artmaking hobbypopMUSEUM stake their identity on the  theatrics of fantasised scenarios and the strong narrative trail or  journey through their exhibitions and happenings as a long-term ‘fight  for ideas’.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exhibition opens at Eastside Projects on <strong>7 May at 6pm</strong> and will run from <strong> 8 May to 12 June 2010.</strong></p>
