				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a meeting yesterday it was decided that the Arts Council will not fund any further plans from <a href="http://www.thepublic.com/" target="_blank">The Public</a>, West Bromwich, including those for the long awaited interactive gallery. The reasons given are an absence of a firm opening date for the gallery and the considerable increase in annual revenue funding required to deliver the plan. It was announced last year that tickets for the gallery will be priced at £6.95 for adults, which <a href="http://www.expressandstar.com/2008/06/02/anger-at-7-fee-to-visit-the-public/">stoked the fires</a> of many angry taxpayers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2916" title="public_ready" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/public_ready.jpg" alt="public_ready" width="468" height="313" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/public_ready.jpg 468w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/public_ready-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></p>
<p>They have, however awarded Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council an award of up to £3m to allow them to develop a revised plans and to bring the building fully into public use. The Arts Council’s intention is that the significant investment made by all the funders will benefit the residents of Sandwell.</p>
<p><!-- CLOSE PARA 2 --><!-- CLOSE PARA 3 -->Sir Christopher Frayling, Chair of Arts Council England, said:</p>
<p><!-- CLOSE PARA 4 --><!-- CLOSE PARA 5 --></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are the national development agency for the arts, and investing in ground breaking creative projects that have the potential to give more people access to great art is central to what we do. That is why we supported this project and why, at every stage, we have worked with our partners and carefully weighed the level of risk involved against the potential public benefit.</p>
<p>But the fact is that, although the building is open, the interactive art gallery at the centre of the vision for The Public is not. We have done everything we can but there comes a point where we have to make a difficult judgement &#8211; and regretfully, that moment is now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Public will be releasing a statement later on today.</p>
<p><!-- CLOSE PARA 6 --><!-- CLOSE PARA 7 --></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kinda charming this is:</p>
<blockquote><p>From 12 &#8211; 30 August, Ikon is running a tailor shop in the old Salvation Army charity shop, 3 New Street, Erdington.Â  Led by creative facilitator Jess Worley and local members of the <a href="http://erdoarts.blogspot.com/">Erdington Arts Forum</a>, the shop will be making small fabric whales designed by pupils from Erdington Hall Primary School</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s to tie in with <a href="http://www.domusweb.it/domus2k6/source/contents/item.cfm?type=NWS&amp;ID=132735&amp;lingua=_eng">Claudia Losi&#8217;s Balenaproject</a> &#8211; the installation of a lifesize cashmere whale at the Ikon gallery in September (obviously&#8230;).Â  Rather than something that big, the tailor shop will produce 85 of the smaller whales.</p>
<p>If you can sew, have at least eight days to commit and would like to get involved with the project then give Claire (Ikon&#8217;s Education Curator) a call on 0121 248 0708.</p>
<p>More info on the <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/news/8/2008/ikon_opens_tailor_shop_in_erdington/">Ikon Gallery news page</a>.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of the Ikon, the gallery is still opening til 8pm on Wednesdays until 10 September and the guests for the remaining &#8216;<a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/214/late_night_opening_events/">These are a few of my favourite things</a>&#8216; are:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 August &#8211; David Prentice, one of Ikonâ€™s founder artists</li>
<li>13 August &#8211; Glenn Howells, architect</li>
<li>20 August &#8211; juneau/projects/, artists Ben Sadler and Philip Duckworth</li>
<li>27 August &#8211; David Lodge, writer</li>
<li>3 September &#8211; Kelly Large, artist</li>
<li>10 September &#8211; Jonnie Turpie, Director of Digital Media, Maverick Television</li>
</ul>
<p>Places for those are free but need to be reserved by calling Ikon on 0121 248 0708.</p>
