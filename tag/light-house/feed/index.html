				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve spotted a few groups looking for helpful volunteers. Here are a few you might want to take a look at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theflyovershow.com/">The Flyover Show</a> is taking place this Saturday, 18th of August, and are looking for a few extra pairs of hands to help out. Each year the space under the Hockley flyover is transformed into an arena for this day of hip hop, reggae and jazz. For more information please email <a href="mailto:clareedwards@mac.com">Clare Edwards</a></p>
<p>Light House Media Centre in Wolverhampton are searching for <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/what-we-do/ambassador-scheme/">Ambassadors</a>. In return for a range of benefits Ambassadors promote the venue to their friends, colleagues and online networks.</p>
<p>Every year <a href="http://oxjambrum.org.uk/">Oxjam Brum</a> takeover a bunch of city centre venues to put on a one-day festival of live music with local bands and artists, with all proceeds going to Oxfam. They are always on the lookout for all kinds of creatives, including photographers, designers, artists&#8230; and even cake decorators, who would like to help them put on a bigger and better show. If this sounds like you please contact them <a href="http://oxjambrum.org.uk/contact/">here</a>.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the local festival season due to it&#8217;s chilled out vibe and wonderful location, <a href="http://www.moseleyfolk.co.uk/">Moseley Folk Festival</a> returns on the 31st August and 1st and 2nd September. They are currently recruiting a team of friendly, motivated stewards to help the weekend run smoothly. In return for two 4 hour shifts volunteers can enjoy the rest of the 3 day festival. Find out more <a href="http://www.moseleyfolk.co.uk/contact-us/volunteer-opportunities/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> is the annual weekend of all things artistic in Birmingham, when the city attempts to show off the breadth and depth of it&#8217;s creative and cultural sector. It advertises itself as the UK&#8217;s biggest free arts festival, and relies on a team of volunteers. Taking place during the second weekend in September, which this year is the 7th to the 9th, applications for volunteers have closed but if you&#8217;d like to add yourself to the reserve list details can be found <a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/volunteers/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tedxbrum.org/">TEDxBrum</a> brings the renowned series of talks and ideas by inspirational speakers to Birmingham. After a successful inaugural event this year they are currently <a href="http://www.tedxbrum.org/blog/tedx-brum-team-2013-we-want-you/">recruiting a team</a> for 2013. Among roles in production, marketing and communication perhaps of interest is &#8216;Non-Speaker Content Curation&#8217; which will help expand the performances and exhibitions which will take place on the day.</p>
<p>Finally, another music festival, <a href="http://www.supersonicfestival.com">Supersonic</a>, is looking for volunteers. Taking place in Digbeth in October, Supersonic is curated by Birmingham-based promoters Capsule. For more information contact <a href="mailto:volunteer@capsule.org.uk">volunteer@capsule.org.uk</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d post my response to an email I received from someone the other day. The emailer said (and these are a couple of extracts):</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently looking for creative projects to get involved with in the Birmingham area, specifically film or media based projects. I have lots of transferable skills through studying film on my course and I am looking for possible work experience (unpaid) in TV, film or any kind of production, as a runner, film grip and/or any position where the skills I have may come in useful.</p>
<p>My biggest focus is finding opportunities, getting out there and getting involved in anything I can, from possible collaborations to arts events, workshops, anything to keep me busy and anything that allows me to be creative and continues the type of work I was doing on my course.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of anything specific but gave a few starting places. I operate on the assumption that CiB readers know much more than I do, so if anyone can add anything then please do in the comments. My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any specific opportunities at the moment. It&#8217;s a bit of a funny time for that kind of thing at the moment, what with Screen WM (who used to put on events and so on) closing down a few months back and Creative England (the body taking their place) only just getting up and running. In the meantime it might be worth looking at <a href="http://www.bsin.co.uk/">http://www.bsin.co.uk/</a> and seeing what they&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p>Also, have a look at these events, get yourself along and see who you meet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.producersforum.org.uk/">http://www.producersforum.org.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/">http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamsmc.com/">http://www.birminghamsmc.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.helloculture.net/">http://www.helloculture.net/</a> (this is on tomorrow)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Maybe see what courses are happening at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/ ">http://www.macarts.co.uk/</a> or <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/">http://light-house.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p></blockquote>
