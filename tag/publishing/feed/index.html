<p>A book written and published independently by local writer Matt Wilding.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tristan Marley is a  drunk. He is dishonest, work-shy, selfish and a murderer of kittens. He has no self respect, failed dreams, and feels as though the world, which is crueler  to he than any other man, owes him one.</p>
<p>Forced to take up  menial employment, and instantly despising it,  Tristan concocts a devilish  scheme to secure the big pay day that he  undeniably deserves. Chewed up, and  spat out, Tristan is left at the brink of his own sanity, maimed and drowning  in a constant supply of  whiskey, when a chance encounter with a magpie changes  everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you like the sound of that, you can <a href="http://www.magpiepress.co.uk/Sample_Chapter_One.pdf">read the opening chapter</a> in full and <a href="http://www.magpiepress.co.uk/shop.html">buy the book</a> over at Magpie Press.</p>
<p>The lovely cover art has been designed by local illustrator, Charlotte Audrey Owen-Meehan, who also curated the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/04/22/not-my-type/">Not My Type exhibition</a> which you&#8217;ll probably remember from the CiB Shop.</p>
