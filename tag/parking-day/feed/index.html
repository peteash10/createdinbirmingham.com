<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s the day for leaving the car at home and cycling/walking/rollerblading in instead. <a href="http://www.birminghamfoe.org.uk/transport-news/in-town-without-my-car-day-sign-up">Sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of cycling-related events in the city centre, I&#8217;d have liked the <a href="http://www.goskyride.com/">Sky Ride</a> that took place the other weekend a lot more if there had been any useful information <em>anywhere</em> about which roads were being closed off. Grumble.</p>
<p>Oh, and on a vaguely related note, did anyone do anything for <a href="http://parkingday.org/">Park(ing) Day</a> on Friday?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re out and about today you might catch the over-capitalised (shouty?) ROADWORKS project, Birmingham&#8217;s contribution to <a href="http://www.parkingday.org/">PARK(ing) Day</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Located in close proximity to Victoria Square, St Phillips Cathedral  (Colmore Row) and Waterloo Street the ROADWORKS will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‘Not My Type’ by Fluid Design and collective illustrators</strong><br />
Three easels will be set up and some of Birmingham’s best graphic  designers will be demonstrating their skills, illustrating letters forms  and numbers, as the public look on.</li>
<li><strong>‘Camera Obscura ‘ by Arlene Burnett</strong><br />
This will be a ‘walk in camera’ in a light proof garden shed, projecting  an image of some of Birmingham’s impressive civic buildings onto its  inside surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>‘The Incidental Estate’ by Trevor Pitt</strong><br />
A domestic, suburban garden transplanted into the city centre. A space  to sit in, enjoy the flowers and consider the sense of freedom it can give you.</li>
<li><strong>Human, All too Human’ by Nat Pitt</strong><br />
This is a bird spotters hide, fitted with periscopes for members of the  public to view animal characters who will be appearing nearby, you may  spot an owl with a pushchair, a cat traffic warden or a badger with a  briefcase.</li>
<li><strong>‘Digger’s Revival’ by Uddin and Elsey</strong><br />
This artist’s duo will create a growing environment, inspired by Van  Gogh’s painting of the ‘Potato Planters’, with wooden pallets, grow bags  and plants. They will invite the public to take away seeds and  encourage them to grow their own vegetables.</li>
</ul>
