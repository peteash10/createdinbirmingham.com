				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me, arts funding is an area that&#8217;s shrouded in mystery and confusion. But then I&#8217;ve never applied for any, so maybe it&#8217;s not such a big deal.</p>
<p>Anyway, two folks who have recently shed some light on the situation are Pete Ashton and Clare Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>Pete</strong> went along to the Arts Council yesterday to chat about the Digital Content Development (DCD) fund. In <a href="http://ash10.com/2009/10/the-arts-council-west-midlands-dcd-fund-some-notes/">a lovely, comprehensive post</a> he&#8217;s found out what the fund&#8217;s for, what organisations have been doing wrong in their applications to date and what Anna Douglas and Steve Manthorp (the fund&#8217;s administrators) are looking for in applications.</p>
<p>Pete would also like to make it clear he&#8217;s available to help organisations (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">RFO&#8217;s only I&#8217;m afraid</span>) who are trying to figure out what to use the fund for.</p>
<p><strong>Clare</strong> was recently asked for advice on finding funding for a creative project. She was happy to help and thought it&#8217;d be useful to put her tips in a blog post, so here are <a href="http://clareedwards.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/finding-funding-for-your-creative-project/">Clare&#8217;s tips for finding funding for a creative project</a>.</p>
