They went and used a picture of Birmingham, Alabama&#8217;s skyline on a leaflet.Â  They seem to have used the first pic that came up when they searched &#8216;Birmingham skyline&#8217; with Google &#8211; not that they were prepared to admit that at first, which is probably why every man and their blog has written about this now.Â  Ah well.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pogus-caesar-oom-gallery.jpg" rel="lightbox[1781]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1782" title="pogus-caesar-oom-gallery" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pogus-caesar-oom-gallery.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="338" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pogus-caesar-oom-gallery.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pogus-caesar-oom-gallery-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>An exhibition currently running at the <a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/wolves/exhibitions/003633.html">Wolverhampton Art Gallery</a> showcases the photography of <a href="http://www.oomgallery.net/">Pogus Caesar</a>, one of Birmingham&#8217;s most important visual artists.</p>
<p>The exhibition, <a href="http://www.oomgallery.net/gallery.asp?location=48&amp;c=42654">That Beautiful Thing</a>, features 43 photographs selected from a portfolio that runs into several thousands taken over a 20 year period both in the UK and abroad.</p>
<p>Putting the breadth and importance of Pogus Caesar&#8217;s work in perspective is a tricky thing &#8211; he&#8217;s well known for his photos of 1985&#8217;s Handsworth riots (the pic above being an example) but his experience, travels and areas of work are all incredibly wide. Roger Shannon does a good job of pulling it all together in this <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/postfeatures/2008/05/08/life-through-a-lens-with-pogus-caesar-65233-20881116/">Birmingham Post</a> article.</p>
<p>The exhbition runs until 12 July.Â  In addition, on 3 July from 6-8pm at the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-admin/www.light-house.co.uk ">Light House</a>, Caesar will celebrate</p>
<blockquote><p>20 years working in Television and Film with a screening of selected highlights from his award winning career, including work produced and directed for Central TV, BBC, Channel 4 and Carlton Television.</p></blockquote>
<p>Throughout the screening he&#8217;ll be in conversation with Prof Shannon.Â  Entrance is free.</p>
