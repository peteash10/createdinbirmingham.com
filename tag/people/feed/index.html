				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ll have to excuse some slightly hectic posting this week and next while I get my head round 300ish new RSS feeds and an inbox stuffed with interesting (and hopefully not yet out of date) emails.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also introduce myself properly later but for now, here&#8217;s a round-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">aCtiVe arts</a> is a steering group, made up of committed residents and local professionals, dedicated to providing quality arts experiences and opportunities for the Castle Vale community of North-East Birmingham&#8221;.  They have <a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">a blog</a> and you are advised to see what they&#8217;re doing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next <a href="http://www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk/">Drop Beats Not Bombs</a> runs from Friday 2 to Monday 5 May (the bank holiday) and tickets are available.  That&#8217;s at The Rainbow (and the warehouse and arches) in Digbeth.  There should be more info on their website but it was having bandwidth issues last I checked.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The people at the <a href="http://www.thepeopleshop.co.uk/">People</a> shop in Kings Heath are having a party with drinks and canapÃ©s at their store on Saturday 26th April from 10am until 5:30pm.  It&#8217;s in aid of Macmillan, there&#8217;s a raffle for a luxury goodie bag and visitors can have their photo taken by <a href="http://www.emilyquinton.com/">Emily Quinton</a>. Get all the info <a href="http://thepeopleshop.co.uk/index.php?main_page=fundraising">here</a>.Â  **UPDATE** It was a big success with Â£430 raised on the day.Â  More events will follow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simon has started a blog called <a href="http://birminghamcentral.blogspot.com/">Birmingham Central</a>.  He says he&#8217;s &#8220;been inspired by the recent blogging epidemic sweeping Birmingham and the value of a good blog to share news and information&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of bloggers, the next Birmingham Bloggers meet-up will be on Tuesday 29 April at Rooty Frooty in the Custard Factory.  <a href="http://www.podnosh.com/blog/2008/04/22/birminghambloggersmeet4/">Nick Booth</a> has more info but I refer you also to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=12243583846">Facebook event</a> and the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/495801/">Upcoming</a> page.</li>
</ul>
