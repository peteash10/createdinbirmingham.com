<p><strong> Love is Enough: runs at BMAG 25 April – 6 September 2015</strong></p>
<p>Following a stint at Modern Art Oxford, <a href="http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/bmag/whats-on/love-is-enough-william-morris-and-andy-warhol" target="_blank">Love is Enough</a>, an exhibition bringing together two artistic legends, will be coming to Birmingham. Curated by <a href="http://www.jeremydeller.org/" target="_blank">Jeremy Deller</a>, this visual feast of an exhibition launches today and will run until September. It features the work of Andy Warhol and William Morris, two artists you wouldn&#8217;t automatically draw together, but the exhibition draws several parallels, surrounding mass production and pattern making amongst other comparisons.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of either artist, or indeed of patterns, it&#8217;s well worth a visit (I was lucky enough to see the exhibition in Oxford).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lovely selection of images of the team installing the artworks on the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/creative/countdown-andy-warhol-william-morris-9056676" target="_blank">Birmingham Post site</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Today (14th February) sees the start of <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/" target="_blank">New Art West Midlands</a> 2014. It was announced in December that 24 emerging artists from our own regional universities would exhibit their work within four different galleries across Birmingham and Wolverhampton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.tpwestmidlands.org.uk/">A Turning Point West Midlands</a> initiative, New Art West Midlands exhibits the work of 24 artists, all of whom have graduated from one of the region’s undergraduate and postgraduate fine art degree courses in the past three years: Birmingham City University, Coventry University, Staffordshire University, University of Wolverhampton and University of Worcester.  Encompassing four nationally important galleries plus five universities, it is the largest partnership of its kind in England.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Who are the Artists?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of the artists have recently come from undergraduate and postgraduate courses. There really is a great range of different artists <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/nawm-2014" target="_blank">here</a>, with their work ranging from sculpture, film, photography, performance to painting.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://barber.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://barber.org.uk/our-governance/">The Barber Institute Steering Committee</a> is chaired by the University of Birmingham’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Professor Michael Whitby as well as representatives from the University’s College of Arts and Law, the Henry Barber Trust and the Friends of the Barber Institute. The Barber Institute of Fine Arts owes its existence to the vision of Dame Martha Constance Hattie Barber (1869–1933). First opened by Queen Mary in 1939, the art deco building owes its design to architect Robert Atkinson (1833-1952) and has since been a home to major art collections, a public gallery and the original concert hall for the University of Birmingham. Their collection includes paintings by Old Masters including Botticelli, Rubens, Gainsborough and Turner, as well as Impressionist and other 19th and 20th-century masterpieces by Monet, Degas, Renoir and Magritte.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Barber Institute will be exhibiting the work of Caroline Ali, James Birkin, Sade Buckle, Leah Carless, Cheryl Howard, Sikander Pervez, Glen Stoker, Wendy Ann Titmus and Chris Wright from the 14<sup>th </sup>February – 27<sup>th </sup>April.

Based at 19 Minerva Works in Fazeley, Grand Union is an exciting artist-led project space that houses 8 purpose built studios (and they really are lovely!) which were designed by designer Matthew Higginbottom with <a href="http://queenandcrawford.com/" target="_blank">Queen &amp; Crawford</a>. As well as exhibiting the works from the Turning Point West Midlands artists, Grand Union will also be hosting a talk on the <a href="http://grand-union.org.uk/gallery/artists-talk-new-art-west-midlands-2014/" target="_blank">17<sup>th</sup> February</a> from 6:30pm till 8:00pm featuring artists Leah Carless, Sarah Sehra, Anna Smith, Glen Stoker and Hannah Sutherland.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery</a> opened on 28th November 1885. Birmingham’s citizens had campaigned for a Corporation Art Gallery for over 40 years. The generosity of manufacturers such as Thomas Clarkson Osler, Richard and George Tangye, and Mayors Joseph and Richard Chamberlain, secured the art gallery for the town. Now funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and Birmingham City Council it now boasts over 500,000 objects to make up the numerous collections that originate from each of the continents and dating from 200,000 years ago to the modern day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Having recently held the successful Photorealism Exhibition (still open until 30<sup>th</sup> March) they will be exhibiting the Turning Point West Midland’s Artists from the 14<sup>th</sup> February – 18<sup>th</sup> May.</p>

Opening times are between 10am – 5pm all week apart from Friday when they open a little later, 10.30am – 5pm.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/" target="_blank">Wolverhampton Art Gallery</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/">WAVE</a> is a collection of buildings.

Wolverhampton Art Gallery has a range of collections and regularly exhibits new works, including contemporary pieces as well as grand paintings dating back as far as the 18<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not only is Wolverhampton Art Gallery a great resource for artworks, they are also involved with their community, regularly running events and workshops that are open to the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wolverhampton Art Gallery is open from Monday – Saturday between the hours of 10am – 5pm. They will be exhibiting the work of Sade Buckle, Sharon Farrelly, Amelia Greville, Emily Mulenga, Sarah Sehra, Anna Smith and Wendy Ann Titmus.

&#8220;&#8216;Birmingham Faces and Places&#8217; is a late nineteenth century publication celebrating the great and the good in Birmingham, people and places.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack</a> and <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org">Fierce</a> have barely begun, but I&#8217;ve already been taking a sneak peek of a few of the things they&#8217;ve got going on, including <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing Room</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> and a trip over to the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/events/?venue=the-dirty-end">Dirty End</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9494" title="symphony of a missing room" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="385" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg 605w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yesterday morning I headed over to <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a>, for a visit unlike any other. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing</em> Room by Lundahl &amp; Seitl</a>, feeling slightly apprehensive as I was given a pair of wireless headphones, blindfolded and led cautiously around the museum by sounds, voices and a mysterious hand. The whole experience was what I can only describe as dream like, and had me leaving feeling like I&#8217;d been awoken from a deep, disorienting sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far it&#8217;s been receiving plenty of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/symphony%20of%20a%20missing%20room">rave reviews on Twitter</a>, who all seem to be able to put the experience into words so much better than I can. If you want to check it out for yourself, <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room">book via the Fierce website</a>, it&#8217;s definitely one to give a go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last night also saw the launch of both Flatpack and Fierce, at <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>, which has been transformed into The Dirty End. Along with live music from <a href="http://www.juneauprojects.co.uk/">Juneau Projects</a>, they had a few tasty treats and cocktails on offer which will apparently be sticking around for most of the festival.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/197004_10150464287900010_522350009_17681481_3984980_n.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9496" title="Juneau Projects" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/197004_10150464287900010_522350009_17681481_3984980_n.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/197004_10150464287900010_522350009_17681481_3984980_n.jpg 640w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/197004_10150464287900010_522350009_17681481_3984980_n-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vintagemobilecinema.co.uk/">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> had it&#8217;s first Flatpack outing this afternoon in Victoria Square, where it gathered quite a few admirers. The 22 seater restored mobile cinema, originally toured British factories from 1967, promoting modern production methods. As one of only seven made, this gem is the last standing after being brought back to life to tour the country once again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9493" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With it&#8217;s cosy little interior, complete with red cinema seats, it feels rather like a mini <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/">Electric</a>. I was also treated to a clip of Buster Keaton&#8217;s silent film <em>Sherlock Junior</em> (1924), which is being screening tomorrow night at the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/an-evening-of-silent-film-and-live-music">Town Hall</a>, accompanied by live organ and piano.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9495" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>If you fancy hopping aboard, the vintage mobile cinema will be at Handsworth Library on Thursday, Birmingham Markets on Saturday, and Cannon Hill Park on Sunday. Take a look at whats on across the weekend over on the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Flatpack site</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and update this post with other Flatpack &amp; Fierce adventures, but in the meantime let us know which events you&#8217;ve made it to and what should be on our &#8216;must see&#8217; lists.</p>
