				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m actually slightly embarrassed to be giving this one any more oxygen &#8211; it&#8217;s a non-story on a slow news day and should really be treated as such. For some reason, though, I&#8217;ve found myself getting sucked in. So&#8230;</p>
<p>To give a bit of background, every so often the city council (or a Birmingham-focussed organisation) will award a contract to a company unfortunate enough to be based somewhere other than Birmingham. In the past couple of years <a href="http://www.marketingbirmingham.com/">Marketing Birmingham</a> and <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">the MAC</a> have been lambasted for looking further afield for suppliers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/lob">Library of Birmingham</a> is the latest, having awarded a PR contract to a company in London called <a href="http://www.colmangetty.co.uk/">Colman Getty</a> after a tendering process which involved several local companies. Unfortunately, the result has been the kind of short-sighted outcry that clamours for protectionism and only makes us look ridiculous, parochial and insecure.</p>
<p>The Birmingham Post have provided the headline most likely to feature in indignant tweets:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/04/05/library-of-birmingham-marketing-contract-awarded-to-london-firm-65233-28466192/">Library of Birmingham marketing contract awarded to London firm</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas Business Desk WM have been a bit more measured with:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/news/151352-midlands-firms-beaten-to-library-pr-contract-by-london-agency.html?news_section=54022">Midlands firms beaten to Library PR contract by London agency</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I like how those two seem to imply slightly different things.</p>
<p><strong>On the plus side</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so they might not be from around these parts, and I can&#8217;t tell whether the best company won (I haven&#8217;t read the proposals and I didn&#8217;t see the pitches) but lets see if they have <em>anything</em> to recommend them.</p>
<p>Colman Getty&#8217;s clients includes cultural and literary institutions like the Saatchi Gallery, Manchester&#8217;s Lowry Centre, the Man Booker Prize, Cheltenham Literary Festival and JK Rowling. So that experience could come in handy when drawing up a &#8220;high impact regional, national and international campaign&#8221; for the LoB.</p>
<p>Although bids of up to £350,000 were invited, they&#8217;ve asked for £292,000 (83% of the total). That seems decent of them, especially as we all know how expensive those London agencies are.</p>
<p>Incidentally, someone mentioned that that&#8217;s a lot of money to spend on marketing. Bearing in mind that&#8217;s to cover activity over a three-year period for a £189m project that&#8217;s meant to give Birmingham some international profile it doesn&#8217;t seem all that much to me.</p>
<p><strong>The interesting bit that&#8217;s been missed</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Colman Getty&#8217;s MD says she&#8217;s looking forward to working with Birmingham City Council and, more interestingly, &#8220;our partners, <a href="http://www.writingwestmidlands.org/">Writing West Midlands</a>&#8220;. So there&#8217;s a local link. It&#8217;ll be good to find out what role they&#8217;ll be playing.</p>
<p><strong>If you only read one thing&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>What I usually do when this issue crops up is point towards <a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/09/local-work-for-local-people.html">the guest post that Fullrange&#8217;s Lee Kemp wrote for the Birmingham Post</a> a couple of years ago. It&#8217;s the best explanation I&#8217;ve come across for why reserving regional projects for regional companies is a bad idea. Although I should give a nod to <a href="http://iam.peteashton.com/local-pride-doesnt-mean-quality/">Pete Ashton&#8217;s post</a> and the comments below it.</p>
<p>So, while I&#8217;m sorry for the likes of <a href="http://www.rewiredpr.com/">Rewired</a> and <a href="http://www.sx-media.com/">S&amp;X</a> (who are understood to have pitched for the work &#8211; and I&#8217;ve only got the BPo and BLWM stories to go from) and others who pitched, it&#8217;s surely healthy to bring others into the city.</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>I might round-up a load of work that companies in Birmingham have been winning from under the noses of other agencies in other cities. No-one seems to make so much of a fuss over that news.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know the deal by now. I witter on about cuts to arts funding and make up for it all with a picture of a bunny at the end. Only this time it&#8217;s a video.</p>
<p>Now, the good thing about writing this twelve hours after today&#8217;s announcement is that everyone else has summarised, pontificated and moved on. I can just link to what they&#8217;ve written. Blogging is ace. Anyway, onward&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/across-board-69-cut-funding-arts-organisations-201/">Arts Council&#8217;s announcement</a>. Fair play to them for getting this out in reasonably good time following the spending review.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/news/?id=897">Audiences Central have summarised things</a> and the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2010/10/26/rsc-to-lose-1m-in-funding-as-arts-council-cuts-hit-west-midlands-65233-27547754/">Birmingham Post has calculated the cuts</a> the region&#8217;s orgs are going to face from April 2011.</p>
<p>To skip through the announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/regular-funding-organisations/">regularly funded organisations</a> will have their funding cut by 6.9% in 2011/2012</li>
<li>By 2014/15 cuts will have risen to 14.9% in real terms (ie. ignoring inflation)</li>
<li><a href="http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/">Arts and Business</a> and <a href="http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/">Creativity, Culture and Education</a> will have their public funding halved next year and taken away completely the year after that. That&#8217;s very bad news for them</li>
<li>The Arts Council will have to halve its admin costs</li>
<li>There&#8217;ll be a new system for funding from 2012 onwards (arrangements to be announced 4 November 2010). Everyone will have to reapply &#8211; some existing orgs won&#8217;t be successful, some new ones will</li>
<li>The budget for budget for &#8216;strategic opportunities for artistic work&#8217; such as touring, large events and the Cultural Leadership Programme is being knocked down by 64%</li>
</ul>
<p>Next year will be a &#8216;transition year&#8217;, hence the lower-than-expected cuts, the stay of execution for A&amp;B and CCE and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/oct/26/arts-bodies-face-budget-cuts?CMP=twt_gu">the Guardian describing arts groups as &#8216;relieved&#8217;</a>. So expect things to get worse. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget the local authority funding that&#8217;s disappearing.</p>
<p>In A&amp;B&#8217;s &#8216;defence&#8217; Colin Tweedy has released <a href="http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/Home/News/2010/october/response-to-funding-decisions.aspx">an utterly unimpressive statement</a> quoting <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-10-25a.1.10&amp;s=speaker:10632#g3.0">an easily-swatted away question in Parliament</a> and referring to the generalised views of unnamed &#8216;private sector partners&#8217;. Go get em, tiger.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s not all bad news in the arts. Working at the top at the Royal Opera House <a href="http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/eadweardmuybridge/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/templates/artsdesk2009/images/plugins/system/jceutilities/themes/standard/css/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2465:royal-opera-house-chief's-%C2%A3630000-salary&amp;Itemid=105">can net you £630,000 a year</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsBbE7c2P28">the bunny vid</a>:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been involved in anything that <a href="http://www.advantagewm.co.uk/">Advantage West Midlands</a> (this region&#8217;s RDA) has supported (and I&#8217;d be surprised if you haven&#8217;t in <em>some</em> way or other) then this is relevant to you, even if, on the surface, it might seem turgid, overly political and dull.</p>
<p>You may have heard of the government&#8217;s plans for <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/performanceframeworkpartnerships/localenterprisepartnerships/">Local Enterprise Partnerships</a> (LEPs):</p>
<blockquote><p>joint local authority-business bodies brought forward by local authorities themselves to promote local economic development &#8211; to replace Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/blog/?p=479">Marc Reeves has written an amusing summary</a> of the situation in the West Midlands. Or it would be amusing if this stuff wasn&#8217;t quite so important. Essentially it&#8217;s all a bit of a mess. Here&#8217;s the substantial bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Business VoiceWM, 17 Chambers of Commerce and their affiliates, IoD, CBI, the EEF, FSB, the Noddy Club, and Kingswinford Lions have joined with 65 other business organisations to each separately make several statements about how united they all are about Doing Something Serious for the West Midlands. Unfortunately, none of them quite knows what that is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marc suggests we compare and contrast this with <a href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/news/27835-city-region-to-launch-rda-replacement.html?news_section=5">the harmonious situation in Leeds</a>. Manchester seem to be doing pretty well too. If you want more detail then <a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/david_bailey/">David Bailey in the Birmingham Post</a> has been worth a read on this subject recently. Follow <a href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/">The Business Desk (WM)</a> too.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a worry going round that businesses aren&#8217;t sufficiently involved in the discussions around what might/might not come out of all this. I&#8217;d bet that creative industries businesses/freelancers are even less involved. It&#8217;s important to have a voice in the discussions though, especially given the amount of funding/investment funnelled into the industry and the extent of the cuts predicted.</p>
<p>So people <em>should</em> get involved. There are a few questions though:</p>
<ul>
<li>with the current level of uncertainty, who are the people we should be speaking to?</li>
<li>how should businesses/people get involved?</li>
<li>who&#8217;s getting involved on whose behalf?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answers on a postcard&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s some great comments below. Additionally, Dave Harte has written <a href="http://daveharte.com/birmingham/birminghams-creative-industries-the-business-case/">a stat-stuffed companion piece</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day someone described CiB as &#8216;a little ray of sunshine in [their] RSS reader&#8217;. I&#8217;m going to take time out now to ruin that by talking about funding cuts and such. Sorry. If it&#8217;s any consolation I&#8217;ll end the post with a picture of a bunny.</p>
<p>The other week West Midlands Regional Observatory brought out their latest <a href="http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&amp;site=wmro.wordpress.com&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmro.org%2Fresources%2Fres.aspx%3Fp%3D%2FCmsResource%2FresourceFilename%2F2975%2FWM-cultural-sector-recession-research-summary-jan-10_v1.0_LA.pdf">recession snapshot</a>. For the cultural sector the figures weren&#8217;t bad:</p>
<blockquote><p>the cultural sector continued to see increases in numbers of  customers through the door in the last three months of 2009, building on  the unusually high increase in footfall seen over the summer.</p>
<p>Strong audience figures suggest the value  placed on culture by the general population has only increased during  the economic troubles</p></blockquote>
<p>However, people are expecting cuts &#8211; 72% of respondents being &#8216;less optimistic&#8217; about the stability of core funding compared to a few years ago. Quite right too &#8211; on a daily basis you hear politicians dodging around the c-word like [insert inappropriate simile here].</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/jeremy_hunt/south_west_surrey">Jeremy Hunt</a>, the shadow culture secretary, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/jan/14/arts-funding-cuts-proposed-conservatives">has gone some way towards setting his stall out</a> (could The Guardian have found a pic of him looking any more smug?), saying (and I paraphrase hugely):</p>
<ul>
<li>arts administration costs need to be hacked back to 5% of any cash government hands over</li>
<li>they&#8217;ll introduce a US-style culture of philanthropy by encouraging tax breaks on lifetime  giving</li>
<li>The national lottery would be returned to its original good causes (which includes arts)</li>
<li>they&#8217;d get rid of audience development targets in the arts</li>
</ul>
<p>Some might find encouragement in some of that, although he did add:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that everything that happened under the last Conservative  government was good</p></blockquote>
<p>So nevermind.</p>
<p>The philanthropy thing has been jumped upon and was clearly at the forefront of people&#8217;s minds on a recent Cultural Leadership Programme session, as blogged about by Friction Arts in a post called <a href="http://www.frictionarts.com/preparing-for-a-cultural-nuclear-winter/">Preparing for a Cultural Nuclear Winter</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=559">On the Stan&#8217;s Cafe blog</a> James gives the benefit of their experience and says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Big UK arts institutions are already doing all they can to raise  sponsorship and court donors, it’s not as if a funding cut is ‘required’  to prod them into action. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>In short, the US model is deeply flawed and we are a million miles  away from being able to deliver that model as well as they do.</p></blockquote>
<p>As things stand <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/birmingham-art/2010/01/16/arts-and-culture-funding-drying-up-in-midlands-65233-25601866/">the figures, for the West Mids in particular, support him</a>, the Birmingham Post pulling the numbers from <a href="http://www.aandb.org.uk/News/2010/jan/lon_pics0809_headlinefigures.aspx">analysis by Arts &amp; Business</a>. The headline numbers there being that in the West Mids private investment dropped 25% over the last period, while the national average was a drop of 7%.</p>
<p>A&amp;B chief Colin Tweedy said that:</p>
<blockquote><p>We would like to be optimistic but predict the worst is yet to come</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the bunny:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Little bunny bun by jpockele, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jpockele/3746043763/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2498/3746043763_2a1f2b1560.jpg" alt="Little bunny bun" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, <a href="http://www.thebigdebatebirmingham.co.uk/">can the Midlands&#8217; creative industries revolutionise the UK economy?</a></p>
<p>Well, I wasn&#8217;t at The Big Debate on Monday, so I can&#8217;t tell you what the answer was. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/bigdebate/2009/11/03/big-debate-s-ideas-for-supporting-creative-economy-65233-25075916/">a list of ideas</a> that came out of the event, although if that&#8217;s anything to go by the answer was &#8220;no, we need to sort ourselves out before telling the rest of the country what to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>That may not be an accurate summary though.</p>
<p>If you want to find out for yourselves, the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/bigdebate/2009/11/02/live-webchat-and-video-streaming-from-the-big-debate-65233-25071486/">live stream and blog</a> are both archived on the Birmingham Post website. I hear Charles Leadbetter was good.</p>
<p>Personally, I was impressed by the series of blog posts that preceded the main event:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/comment/birmingham-columnists/agenda/2009/11/02/birmingham-post-editor-marc-reeves-on-how-creative-industries-in-the-west-midlands-can-advance-65233-25067748/">The Post&#8217;s own Marc Reeves</a> wrote an excellent piece criticising the &#8220;erratic approach to creating ‘quarters’ across the city&#8221; and addressing access to finance saying &#8220;Put simply, many in the creative sector need to grow up, put on a suit, and get to know how finance works&#8221;. Well worth a read</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/09/local-work-for-local-people.html">Fullrange&#8217;s Lee Kemp</a> was persuasive on  regional work projects being reserved for regional (in his view a very bad idea)</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/10/measuring-the-impact-its-a-bea.html">Screen WM&#8217;s Jason Hall</a> talked about how to prove the impact of creative stuff. Answer &#8211; join a network. If there isn&#8217;t one for you then start one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, since the event, <a href="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2009/11/03/the-big-debate-taking-people-out-of-their-comfort-zones/">Paul Bradshaw</a> has countered those who complained of too much talk and too little action. <a href="http://blogs.birminghampost.net/business/2009/11/the-big-debate---the-big-myths.html">Dave Harte has done likewise</a> while attempting to lay a few other myths to rest. <a href="http://rebeccasykes.co.uk/safe-haven-for-pirates/">Rebecca Sykes</a> and <a href="http://andrewbrightwell.com/blog/birmingham/ten-things-birmingham-can-do-to-welcome-the-pirates/">Andrew Brightwell</a> have put their thoughts down too.</p>
<p>If anyone was there it&#8217;d be good to get your thoughts on the event.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually a little tricky to find out about local music around the city, I find. This is the stuff I know about, feel free to add other stuff in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>News</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.brumnotes.com/">Brum Notes</a> is the website for the free, monthly music and lifestyle magazine (Nov issue out now, <a href="http://issuu.com/brumnotesmagazine/docs/october">Oct one online here</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/music-in-birmingham/">Birmingham Post have news and reviews here</a> and the Birmingham Mail do <a href="http://www.birminghammail.net/what-is-on-in-birmingham/rock-and-pop/">rock/pop news</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/">Fused Magazine</a>&#8216;s site does the odd bit of music news, as does the website for sister magazine <a href="http://areamagazine.wordpress.com/">Area</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surgemusic.com/">Surge Music</a> takes a wider, Midlands-wide view of things, with articles and lists of gigs, bands and venues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.culdesaconline.com/">Cul-de-Sac</a> turned out to be a false dawn for this sort of thing, but may come back one day.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/birminghamlive">@birminghamlive</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/brumpunks">@brumpunks</a> are good sources for concert info too.</p>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.brumlive.com/">Birmingham Live</a> is the obvious choice here &#8211; someone from their ranks of volunteer reviewers and photographers will be at a gig in Birmingham pretty much every evening. <a href="http://stevegerrardphotography.com/blog/">Steve Gerrard</a> organises this one (<a href="http://www.leeallenphotography.com/">Lee Allen</a> and I have also chipped in occasionally).</p>
<p><a href="http://thehearingaid.blogspot.com/">The Hearing Aid</a> is a blog by someone called The Baron who goes to an impressive number of local gigs.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birminghammail.net/what-is-on-in-birmingham/birmingham-gig-reviews/">Birmingham Mail do gig reviews</a> too.</p>
<p><strong>Get-togethers</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/">Birmingham Music Network</a> meets monthly at the Department of Technology, Engineering and the Environment (T.E.E.) at Millennium Point. Their website has a good range of resources too.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m on shakier ground here &#8211; which radio shows promote local talent There&#8217;s <a href="http://brumcast.podomatic.com/">Brumcast</a> on <a href="http://www.rhubarbradio.com/">Rhubarb Radio</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2007/07/12/daz_hale_introduces_feature.shtml">Introducing on BBC WM</a>. I don&#8217;t know enough about the shows on <a href="http://www.newstyleradio.co.uk/">New Style Radio</a>, <a href="http://www.astonfm.com/astonFM/Default.htm">Aston FM</a> or any others.</p>
<p>Are there any Birmingham-based mp3 blogs worth talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Anything else?</strong></p>
<p>Let me know in the comments. Just to be clear, we&#8217;re not looking for bands/venues/promoters to plug themselves but if that&#8217;s you, where do you look to get featured?</p>
<p>Oh, and see also <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/10/12/birmingham-listings-websites/">Birmingham listings</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/politics-news/2009/10/20/birmingham-council-s-100-000-communications-chief-debra-davis-attacks-own-department-65233-24968264/">Marc Reeves on the Birmingham Post</a> editor&#8217;s blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>In three weeks&#8217; time, the last daily edition of the printed version of the Birmingham Post will roll off our presses in Erdington, marking the end of a publishing tradition that stretches back more than 150 years</p></blockquote>
<p>Roy Greenslade <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2009/oct/20/trinity-mirror-birmingham-mail?commentpage=1">rounds up the changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Birmingham Post, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/aug/25/birmingham-post-newspaper-weekly-recession">as forecast in the summer</a>, is to go weekly; the Birmingham Mail will become an overnight, morning title; both editors are leaving; and there will be about 80 redundancies across the group</p></blockquote>
<p>There are plans to put the titles on a more even keel, but this isn&#8217;t good news and sympathies go to those who&#8217;ll be affected.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of the Post, they had the most fantastic front-page story this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/politics-news/2009/10/20/birmingham-council-s-100-000-communications-chief-debra-davis-attacks-own-department-65233-24968264/">Birmingham council’s £100,000 communications chief Debra Davis attacks own department</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Bearing in mind that Ms Davis has been running the department for the past two-and-a-half years, there are many questions that spring to mind &#8211; many of them articulated by &#8216;DiliGent&#8217; in the piece&#8217;s 4th comment. Worth a read.</p>

<p>In the Birmingham Post yesterday <a href="http://www.punch-records.co.uk/">Punch Records</a>&#8216; <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/birmingham-business/business-comment/2009/10/05/birmingham-s-black-history-is-being-left-in-the-shade-65233-24852022/">Ammo Talwar spoke his mind</a> on what he sees as Birmingham&#8217;s neglect of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://birminghamblackhistory.com">Black History Month</a>, especially in comparison to the enthusiasm shown over the <a href="http://www.staffordshirehoard.org.uk/">Staffordshire Hoard</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When do we start pleasing the really big crowds – the ones who aren’t there, the ones who want to see something different? Do we have to get a metal detector down to Handsworth to unearth Apache Indian’s first gold tooth, or lock on to Steel Pulse’s forgotten cymbal set?</p>
<p>It’s Black History Month and there should be real effort and real funding to promote the treasures left to us by Birmingham’s black achievers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can&#8217;t argue with that.</p>
<p>The Black History Month website has a full run-down of <a href="http://birminghamblackhistory.com/component/option,com_eventcal/Itemid,22/task,month/date,1254380400&amp;catid=/">everything happening over October</a> (click the link and scroll down the page). It&#8217;s a little tricky to pick things out, although I&#8217;ve heard good things of <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/east-is-east">East is East</a> which is on at The Rep and <a href="http://www.the-drum.org.uk/event/eric-roberson">Eric Roberson will be at The Drum</a> on 10 Oct.</p>
<p>In the Birmingham Post piece Ammo mentions a showing of the controversial documentary, <a href="http://www.punch-records.co.uk/Events/120.aspx">Deen Tight</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Filmed on location with Muslim rappers, DJs, slam poets, breakdancers and a graffiti artist in concerts, recording studios, at homes and in the streets. Our story focuses on the perceived conflict between traditional religious ideals and modernity, as well as both the positives and negatives of Western Pop culture on todays’ Muslim youth</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s at The Drum on 13 October.</p>
