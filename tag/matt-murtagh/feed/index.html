				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not really one for reprinting press releases that are sent to me but I&#8217;ll make an exception. Here follows a message from <a title="Pete Ashton on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/peteashton">Pete</a>.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running a couple of courses which I hope will become regular monthly things.</p>
<p>The first is <a title="Matt and Pete's Photography School" href="http://ash10.com/photo-school/">Matt and Pete&#8217;s Photo School</a> (see <a title="Photo School Poster" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Photo-School-poster.jpg" rel="lightbox[11496]">poster</a>)</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;re combining an academic approach to photography with the the practical peer learning of a Flickrmeet. As well as hobbyists we&#8217;re also looking to help those who can use photography better in their businesses or as a personal development course.</p>
<blockquote><p>Through a combination of group teaching, personal goal setting, one-to-one mentoring and peer learning, Matt and Pete can help you become a better photographer, whether it’s for photos of your family or as a valuable business tool.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first class in on Sunday Feb 6th at The Victoria from 12-5pm. The usual cost is £60 per head but we&#8217;re doing an introductory offer of £25 for February.</p>
<p>The second is <a title="Social Media Group Therapy" href="http://ash10.com/social-media-group-therapy/">Social Media Group Therapy</a> (see <a title="SocMed Group Therapy poster" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/SocMedGroupTherapy-poster.pdf">PDF poster</a>).</p>
<p>This is run with the Moseley Exchange and is aimed at the self-employed and small businesses who are having issues with their online activity. &#8220;Group therapy&#8221; isn&#8217;t just a joke. I think people&#8217;s problems, once unpicked, can be best be answered by those facing the same situations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Social Media Group Therapy avoids the snake oil and magic beans of fly-by-night “experts” with a structured environment of peer learning led by someone who understands the pros and cons of the online world.</p></blockquote>
<p>This course is on Tuesday March 6th at the Moseley Exchange from 6-8pm and costs £25 per person (£20 for Exchange members).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit self-indulgent and it starts with a brief recap, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>Back in Feb, Ian posted something about <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/02/05/birmingham-royal-ballet-choreographers/">BRB presenting some work</a> choregraphed by their dancers. One of the pieces used a track called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is-HVxmUELQ">Printer Jam by Mistabishi</a> and was spotted by the people behind the <a href="http://www.friedmylittlebrain.com/2010/02/28/drum-and-bass-awards-2010-birmingham-uk-28-02-2010-live-sets-from-bailey-sub-focus-and-fabio-grooverider/">Drum and Bass Awards</a>, who invited the dancers to perform it at their launch event.</p>
<p>Matt Murtagh saw the piece and <a href="http://twitter.com/mattmurtagh/status/8980709280">tweeted about it</a>. I <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/02/11/my-contribution-to-audience-development/">posted a screenshot</a> of that tweet on CiB.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230; a screenshot of that tweet on CiB made it into a video intro that was featured at BRB&#8217;s Royal Gala Performance back in March, in front of a packed Hippodrome audience which included Prince Charles. I was there, and it was odd to see little old CiB up on all of those screens in front of all those people.</p>
<p>The point of all of this (in case you were wondering) is that I&#8217;ve just been told that the video&#8217;s now up online:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/12510261" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/12510261">Printer Jam feature</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/roblindsay">Rob Lindsay</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Kit Holder is the man behind the piece and I&#8217;ve got a quote from him about it too:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m really happy about how successful it’s been. When I made the piece I didn’t think it would have such longevity, so I’m chuffed to bits that it’s being performed again. It’s a real testament to the dancers and the technical department, to be honest. I jokingly asked all these different things of them and they ran with the ideas and made it all into a real piece!</p></blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.brb.org.uk/AF-Stars-2010.html">see the piece as part of Artsfest this weekend</a>, with a few other things being performed from 3-4.15pm on the Centenary Square stage.</p>

<p>The exhibition will be open Thursday &#8211; Sunday, 11.00am – 5.30pm, and there will also be an Artists’  Talk on Thursday 9 September, at 6.30pm, allowing members of the public to meet the photographers and discuss the stories behind these powerful images.</p>
