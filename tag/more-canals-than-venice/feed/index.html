				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from Alex&#8217;s post about <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/02/21/ikon-eastside-closure/">Ikon Eastside closing</a>, let me pile on the joy by presenting a few other things that aren&#8217;t going to be around so much.</p>
<p><strong>Birmingham City Council</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/02/18/320m-cuts-will-dismantle-the-structure-of-birmingham-city-council-65233-28194400/">At least not as we know it</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More Canals Than Venice</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/pixiesixer">Annabel</a> has said that, needing to prioritise paying work, she&#8217;s <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/the-end-of-a-chapter">changing her approach to running the site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I intend to discover the new in the city, but at a more leisurely pace and in more depth</p></blockquote>
<p>Which doesn&#8217;t sound all that bad really.</p>
<p><strong>The Yam Yam</strong></p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.theyamyam.com/the-yamyam%E2%80%99s-gooin%E2%80%99-away%E2%80%A6">The Yam Yam</a>, a Walsall-based aggregator of local news, is shutting up shop completely. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theyamyam.com/the-yamyam-reasons-to-be-cheerful">a fuller explanation of what that&#8217;s all about</a>. I was aware of the site but, not living in Walsall, had no particular reason for following it very closely &#8211; the number and content of the comments tell you how much the site was appreciated though.</p>
<p><strong>Next?</strong></p>
<p>In a few weeks time we&#8217;re going to hear about which of the established arts organisations and council services aren&#8217;t going to be supported any more. That&#8217;s not going to be pleasant. There&#8217;ll still be plenty of good stuff for us to write about on CiB, and plenty of individuals doing good things, but we won&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re missing.</p>
<p>On the web side of things, it&#8217;s worth remembering that most of the genuinely interesting websites around are actually quite fragile things and, if they&#8217;re run for personal enjoyment, it&#8217;s probably best not to assume they&#8217;ll be around forever either. See also <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2011/01/brummie-of-the-year-2010.html">Jon Bounds&#8217; comments</a> last month when the harmless bit of fun that was Brummie of the Year turned nasty on BiNS:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll continue to ruminate as to whether the site does its job or is best closed.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m all for a bit of a shake-up, some new voices and some new ways of doing things. We&#8217;ll see how things pan out over the next little while.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>I forgot to end this post with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR6yZqMju_k">some bunnies</a>:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks back I <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/12/22/got-a-minute-to-fill-out-a-survey/">put up a survey</a> because I was interested in seeing which websites or online services people use to find out what’s going on around Birmingham.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had 100 submissions, which seems like a good place to draw things to a close and have a look at the results:</p>
<p><strong>Listings/what&#8217;s on</strong></p>
<p>70 &#8211; Venues&#8217; own websites<br />
49 &#8211; CiBmail<br />
30 &#8211; Birmingham City Council &#8211; What&#8217;s On<br />
29 &#8211; Live Brum<br />
18 &#8211; What&#8217;s on in Brum<br />
17 &#8211; Ticketmaster<br />
14 &#8211; Visit Birmingham<br />
10 &#8211; Scene Central<br />
6 &#8211; Birmingham Alive<br />
4 &#8211; Birmingham Gig Guide<br />
4 &#8211; What&#8217;s On Midlands (online)</p>
<p>Suggestions left in the &#8216;other&#8217; box included The Ticketsellers, Last.fm, Songkick, Ents24, Brum Notes, finditinbirmingham.com, More Canals Than Venice, The Wire and Upcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Arts/culture news</strong></p>
<p>80 &#8211; Created in Birmingham<br />
76 &#8211; Blogs/social network updates from individual artists/organisations<br />
34 &#8211; Digbeth is Good<br />

24 &#8211; Birmingham Post/Mail (online)<br />
20 &#8211; Arts Council England Arts News<br />
15 &#8211; Audiences Central</p>
<p>Others included Ryan&#8217;s Gig Guide, An Craic, We Are Eastside and Area Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Who filled out the survey?</strong></p>
<p>We had a roughly 50:50 male/female split, a wide spread of ages (with a slight skew to 18-25 and 26-35) and pretty much everyone has a B postcode, with a smattering of WV and DY&#8217;s too.</p>
<p><strong>Any conclusions?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing really concrete, but it was interesting. I&#8217;ve got an idea of the level of web traffic of some of the sites listed, so I know that the results certainly doesn&#8217;t indicate which are the most popular websites around the city. However, you could say that this shows which other websites overlap with CiB&#8217;s readership.</p>
<p>If anything, I was expecting the Post &amp; Mail to come up a bit higher. Nice to see Live Brum up there.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out and/or forward on the survey.</p>

<p>Just a quick round up of everything going on this weekend, there&#8217;s a lot and we wouldn&#8217;t want you to forget and miss out on anything!</p>
<p><strong>Cum Clubbing</strong> &#8211; Hosted by <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>,  this art party does not look like something to be missed (although it&#8217;s happening now, so get down quick). From 8pm &#8211;  late, VIVID&#8217;s project space will be taken over by live music, DJs and  visual artists who&#8217;ll conspire to create an excitingly strange evening  of camp disco. Tickets are £5.</p>
<p>To  save time I&#8217;m going to be both lazy and efficient, and link you to  everyone else who&#8217;s been talking about this. Take a look at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2010/09/cum-clubbing-at-vivid-this-saturday-10th-september/">Digbeth is Good</a>, <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/cum-clubbing/">More Canals than Venice</a>, <a href="http://brianduffyhasabigbrain.com/post/1003304250/cum-clubbing-for-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an">brianduffyhasabigbrain</a>, and <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2010/08/cum-clubbing%E2%80%9Cfor-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an-art.html">Birmingham: It&#8217;s Not Shit</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.birminghamzinefestival.com/">Zine Festival</a> </strong>&#8211; Not put off by the scale of Artsfest, this niche festival has a weekend full of events for you to get involved in.</p>
<ul>

<li>Sunday will be a chilled out picnic in <a href="http://http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cannonhillpark">Cannon Hill Park</a> at 1 &#8211; 4pm. With nothing for sale and free to attend, the party will be meeting at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/"><strong>Artsfest</strong></a> &#8211; As <a href="../2010/09/07/artsfest-2010-programme-now-online/">already mentioned</a>,  the weekend of free arts events kicks off this evening and will  continue to entertain through to Sunday night.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wearecolour.com/">Colour</a> is the night run by Cib alumnus Katie Spragg and it returns to The Victoria on Thursday 15 October. Back in February (that long ago) they brought Charlie Parr along &#8211; there&#8217;s a video of him performing a fantastic version of &#8216;<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/3379010">Cheap Wine</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>This time round they&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.cominrecords.com/">Commercially Inviable</a> special starring World of Fox with support from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jamessummerfield" target="_blank">James Summerfield</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/friendsofthestars" target="_blank">Friends of the Stars</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/richardburke" target="_blank">Richard Burke</a>.</p>
<p>Pixie Sixer&#8217;s already written all about it on <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/colour-my-world/">More Canals Than Venice</a> so check that for more info. I&#8217;m <em>really</em> posting this for an excuse to post <a href="http://www.worldoffox.com/ruthgreendesign/">Ruth Green</a>&#8216;s artwork for World of Fox.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/world-of-fox.jpg" rel="lightbox[3849]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3850" title="world-of-fox" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/world-of-fox.jpg" alt="world-of-fox" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/world-of-fox.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/world-of-fox-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Ruth is a recent addition to the <a href="http://lovetoprint.blogspot.com">Love to Print</a> collective &#8211; a project explained on the rather wonderfully named <a href="http://shouldertocrayon.blogspot.com/2009/02/love-to-print.html">Shoulder to Crayon</a>. Most of that collective are also involved with <a href="http://girlswhodraw.wordpress.com/">Girls Who Draw</a>, including <a href="http://www.nursepussy.co.uk/">Karoline Rerrie</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahray.co.uk/">Sarah Ray</a>.</p>
<p>There seems to be quite a tangled web of ladies out there producing pretty, quirky illustrations. See also <a href="http://www.iheartjoan.co.uk/">i heart joan</a> and the <a href="http://inkygoodness.com/">Inkygoodness</a> folks.</p>
