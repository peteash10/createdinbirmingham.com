				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.birminghamsalon.org/events.html#">Birmingham Salon</a> will be debating just that on 8 December at <a href="http://www.studiovenues.co.uk/conference-venues/birmingham/index.htm">The Studio</a>, joined by authors Helene Guldberg with her latest book &#8216;Just Another Ape?&#8217; and Jeremy Taylor discussing &#8216;Not a Chimp: the hunt to  find the genes that make us human&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, the belief that human beings are special is distinctly out of fashion. Almost everyday we are presented with new revelations about how animals are so much more like us than we ever imagined. The argument is at its most powerful when it comes to our closest living relatives &#8211; the great apes.</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;ll be discussing issues including whether apes should have rights and how ape communications have been wrongly elevated to the status of human language.</p>
<p>Anyone up for some deep discussion and heavy debating is welcome, the group will meet from 6.30pm &#8211; 8.15pm.</p>

Worth bearing in mind &#8211; &#8220;I’ve worked out over a few years that “private view” means two things: if a show is big and important it means “no entry unless you’re invited”, if a show is small or not that well known it means “please come, there’ll be free wine and nibbles”. It’s developed as art-jargon for some reason, and people who know know and those that don’t don’t. But it does put off people who might otherwise have liked to have attended—and the smaller shows could do with that, in fact they want it.&#8221; Now to decide if your show is big and important or if it&#8217;s smaller</li>

<p>That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.birminghamsalon.org">Birmingham Salon</a>, that is. Sponsored by the University of Birmingham (nice to see them get off their campus) and to be held regularly from January 2010 &#8211; the first event being on, um, Tues 9 Feb at the<strong>studio</strong>* in the city centre.</p>
<p>The first topic up for debate will be &#8216;Is Childhood in Crisis?&#8217; and will feature contributions from <a href="http://www.heleneguldberg.co.uk/">Dr Helene Guldberg</a>.</p>
<p>I like the look of this (although can&#8217;t make this one) and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what other topics come up.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://johnmostyn.wordpress.com/">John Mostyn</a> for forwarding me the link.</p>
<p>* their daft highlighting, not mine.</p>
