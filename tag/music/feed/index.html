<p style="text-align: justify;">We are all very excited to tell you about the return of the <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/idfb-2014" target="_blank">International Dance Festival Birmingham 2014</a>! You will be able to experience a range of performances from ballet to large non-choreographed social dances. With <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on" target="_blank">so many</a> brilliant performances to talk about, the following will just be a selection of my top picks for the festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-17529"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>For Starters, &#8216;Three Short Works&#8217; 24th &#8211; 26th April</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The International Dance Festival Birmingham 2014 kicks off with &#8216;Three Short Works&#8217;. From the Birmingham Royal Ballet, a selection of performances called Quatrain, Kin, Les Rendezvous and Façade. Les Rendezvous will be available to see from 24th–25th April, with Quatrain and Kin continuing to be shown alongside Façade on 26th April.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">QUATRAIN</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by the fantastically exciting and vibrant tango rhythms of Astor Piazzolla&#8217;s The Four Season&#8217;s of Buenos Aires, Company First Artist Kit Holder creates his third ballet for the Company. Following the success of his previous work, 9-5, which featured in IDFB 2012, these premiere performances of his latest work are keenly anticipated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">KIN.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An exciting new ballet from Royal Opera House Choreographic Affiliate, Sadler&#8217;s Wells New Wave Associate and former Birmingham Royal Ballet dancer, Alexander Whitley. The ballet, to music by young American composer Phil Kline, will receive its’ premiere at IDFB 2014. Not to be missed!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LES RENDEZVOUS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A huge hit when it was first performed in 1933, Les Rendezvous was the first ballet in which Ashton put aside the comedy for which he was known and concentrated on pure technique. Loosely based round a group of friends meeting up in a park, the ballet is a series of fiercely difficult divertissements which give the whole cast the chance to show off their virtuosity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FACADE</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, based on Edith Sitwell&#8217;s deliciously nonsensical poetry, Façade embraces the fun of it all with whole-hearted and wilful abandon. Be entertained by a series of delightful characters dancing tangos, foxtrots and waltzes, all with their tongues firmly in their cheeks. Choreographed in 1931, Façade was Sir Frederick Ashton&#8217;s first big hit, and is full of the gentle comedy he is known and loved for &#8211; an enjoyable break from the sanity of everyday life!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">World Premier, ‘Headphones’ 30th April – 4th May</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promising to provide us with a fresh organic series of performances, <a href="http://www.coreybakerdance.com/about/" target="_blank">Corey Baker</a> brings us ‘Headphones’. In keeping with Corey Bakers’ ethos of producing engaging and unique productions, ‘Headphones’ will allow the audience to direct part of the dancers’ choreography. Set to hide ‘undercover’, the performances will be surprising and unpredictable with elements of comedy.</p>
<p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEWFIx0EL4" target="_blank">this</a> trailer to get an idea of the fun performance, as well as directly suggest moves by tweeting @IDFB #headphones.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217; 14th–17th May</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.new-adventures.net/matthew_bourne" target="_blank">Mathew Bourne</a> has invited 24 young people to join his latest hit production <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies" target="_blank">&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217;</a> based on the classic novel written by William Goulding. There are 8 professional dancers within the cast, to work alongside the newly recruited dancers to give a unique opportunity to young dancers in each city that the production is set to perform in. Because of this the theatre performance has already gained great <a href="http://www.new-adventures.net/latest_news/bbc_breakfast_interview_on_lord_of_the_flies" target="_blank">publicity</a>. The combination of mentoring and unity has made the project a wonderful success already and should be a great motivational piece, especially for young people who with a passion for dance.</p>

<p>&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217; will be performed at The Birmingham Hippodrome over 4 days with tickets available <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies" target="_blank">now</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/08/11/dancexchange/" target="_blank">DanceXchange</a> is housed within <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/" target="_blank">Birmingham Hippodrome</a>, both of whom have worked together to produce the 2014 International Dance Festival Birmingham. Owning 3 dance studios and <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/default.asp?Id=77&amp;sC=page4" target="_blank">The Patrick Centre</a> (a 206 seat studio), DanceXchange strives to support the dancing community and enable their dancers to showcase the best of their talents. &#8216;Spill&#8217; was first shown in 2012, and is an outdoor production that will be performed in the beautiful Cannon Hill Park. Choreographed by Australian Artist Shaun Parker, of Shaun Parker &amp; Company, it should be a playful piece using street gymnastics and location based props of swings and roundabouts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Andrew Dubber" href="http://andrewdubber.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Dubber</a>, <a title="Jon Cotton" href="http://www.artisanaudio.com/" target="_blank">Jon Cotton</a>, <a title="Robin Valk" href="http://radiotogo.com/" target="_blank">Robin Valk</a>, <a title="John Mostyn" href="http://johnmostyn.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">John Mostyn</a> and <a title="Lisa Meyer" href="http://twitter.com/supersonicfest" target="_blank">Lisa Meyer</a> were  all kind enough to share their perspective and ideas for this post &#8211; I&#8217;ll publish their comments in full on my blog so none are wasted. I also drew, with permission, on the Birmingham Music Network&#8217;s recent <a title="10 Questions survey" href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/2011/03/05/10-questions-for-birminghams-independent-music-industry-your-answers-please/" target="_blank">10 Questions survey</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Unparalleled Riches</strong></p>
<p>The comments on the current state of the scene were very encouraging, suggesting there&#8217;s more quality, active musicians in the city than ever before and a number of hardworking and creative promoters as well.</p>
<p>So what improvements might be made to encourage some of the many talented and dedicated individuals and groups to progress further on a professional and national level?</p>
<p><strong>Venues and Noise Abatement</strong></p>
<p>We picked out Kings Heath&#8217;s Hare &amp; Hounds as an example of what a good  local music venue can be (great location, facilities, standard of acts  and size of audiences) but felt there&#8217;s too few live music venues around  for a city and scene of our size.</p>
<p>Recent issues between property developers, the council and independent venues such as  the Fiddle &amp; Bone, the Spotted Dog, the Nightingale and most  recently the Rainbow and Moseley&#8217;s Price of Wales are all situations in  which the city and the community have had the opportunity to act clearly in favour of culture over profit &#8211; if we are to have the courage of our  convictions going forward, common sense prevailing in any similar situation is of vital importance.</p>
<p>Jon Cotton suggests that these issues could very often be solved by small grants  for acoustic improvements to venues &#8211; possibly around £1000 per venue  for simple materials and an hour or two&#8217;s consultancy with an  acoustician.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Festivals</strong></p>
<p>We are fortunate to have some small, quality festivals such as <a title="Moseley Folk" href="http://www.moseleyfolk.co.uk/" target="_blank">Moseley Folk</a> and <a title="Supersonic" href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/supersonic/" target="_blank">Supersonic</a> and efforts should be made to support them as needed as well as identify other existing and emerging festivals and support them too. On the  larger scale, Gigbeth was admired but perhaps fell short of its full potential, whilst the value of ArtsFest is questionable due to its very broad reach and the policy of not paying artists.</p>
<p>Organisational issues aside, a Festival lives or dies on the quality of its curation &#8211; there is a lot of experienced promoters in Birmingham and they are a  resource that should be tapped as much as possible by any future large  scale efforts. As valuable as good intentions might be, its quality that ultimately counts.</p>
<p><strong>Media Support</strong></p>
<p>It seems bizarre that our local radio stations do so little to engage with the local music community. This is both our loss and theirs, since, as  little more than pale imitations of much bigger national operations, their audience figures are dropping rapidly. So its to the grass roots that we might best look to the future. Rhubarb Radio is steadily  expanding with well programmed and sequenced automated play lists  offering a variety of moods at different parts of the day combined with  programmes presented by fast developing local talent and all using West Midlands music. Support for Rhubarb and the likes of South Birmingham Community Radio should be encouraged and need not be financial.</p>
<p>Likewise in the world of print media, the Birmingham Post is down to a weekly and the  Evening Mail, whilst its news coverage is ultra local doesn&#8217;t seem to cover local talent until they are proven on the national stage. Fortunately, we have Indies such as <a title="Area" href="http://areamagazine.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Area</a>, <a title="Brumnotes" href="http://www.brumnotes.com/" target="_blank">Brumnotes</a>, <a title="Radar" href="http://www.theradarmagazine.co.uk/" target="_blank">Radar</a> and <a title="Night Times" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=35836117497" target="_blank">Night Times</a> taking up the slack.</p>
<p><strong>Focal Web Presence</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s good stuff going on the web such as <a href="http://www.livebrum.co.uk/" target="_blank">Live Brum</a> (for listings), review and photos from <a href="http://www.brumlive.com/" target="_blank">Brum Live</a>, long running bloggers such as <a href="http://russl.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Russ L</a>, <a href="http://www.thehearingaid.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Hearing Aid</a>, the directory and blog at <a href="http://birminghammusicnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Birmingham Music Network</a>, a terrific playable online library of music at the <a href="http://www.pilot-project.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pilot Project</a> and archive projects such as the <a title="Birmingham Music Archive" href="http://birminghammusicarchive.co.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Music Archive</a> and <a title="Home of Metal" href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/" target="_blank">Home of Metal</a>.</p>
<p>That said, I still feel something is lacking which could be well filled by something modelled on Created in Birmingham. CiB rarely mentions music for the  good reason that if it covered every decent new album, gig or video, music would completely swamp the other content. Is there a case for a sister Music in Birmingham site?</p>
<p><strong>Facilitation, Not Control</strong></p>
<p>Its very tempting to try and fix things with big, top down initiatives, but often they fail to deliver and given the current financial climate, there&#8217;s not likely to be much public money around for a while. Andrew Dubber suggests that the smartest thing that could be done now is to identify and support already existing and naturally forming scenes and connections, and draw goals and strategies from those communities&#8217; own ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Proud to be Independent</strong></p>
<p>A lot of very exciting music and events are happening through the efforts of people taking initiative and responsibility for their own success. We should be proud and encouraging of this rather than waiting for an  authority figure from either the public or private sector to come along  and validate our efforts with an official seal of approval. John Mostyn goes so far as to suggest that a small pot of public funding should be used to encourage the term &#8216;Unsigned&#8217; to never be used within the City in any way, shape or form by anyone&#8230; ever.</p>
<p><strong>Cherish Diversity</strong></p>
<p>The  diversity of our music and culture may have slowed progress towards a  cohesive and structured scene or community, but maybe that very  diversity has the capability to power us forward to a time of  unparalleled musical output and cultural harmony.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a classical musician, I have often found that contemporary music is met with extreme unnecessary prejudice from most audiences, and even from the musicians themselves. However, we have come a long way since Arnold Schoenberg and his band of merry Serialist pranksters.</p>
<p>We are lucky to live in city so diverse that there is music and art of all types so readily available to us. In the music scene, some artists aren&#8217;t just available, they are begging for audiences to experience their music. I have sourced some excellent music that is being performed in Birmingham in the next month, alone. This is just a tiny snapshot into the world of music and performance that is not achieving quite the audience members that it rightly deserves.</p>
<p>With the news of the cuts happening in the next few years in Birmingham, it is now that we should be celebrating what we, as artists, have to offer. The best way, I feel, to do this, is to see everything. Go to concerts and experience what has been provided to us, show the people in charge of money in this city what, we, as music fans need.</p>
<p><strong>Stravinsky&#8217;s Rite of Spring &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical, dance, technology</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the the CBSO&#8217;s (City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra) biggest projects of the 2010/2011 is it&#8217;s performance of Stravinsky&#8217;s <em>Rite of Spring</em>. A formidable and excellent piece in it&#8217;s own right, the creators at the CBSO and Symphony Hall have fused together music, dance and technology :</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience an astonishing interplay between reality and fantasy as dancer Julia Mach’s extraordinary live performance interacts, through the magic of digital wizardry, with real-time, computer generated stereoscopic projections, translated into a virtual reality space with the aid of 3D spectacles for the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; THSH</p>
<p>The 30-minutes piece is preceded by Varese&#8217;s <em>Tuning Up</em> and Ligeti&#8217;s <em>Lontano</em> for large orchestra, a distant and warm piece which plays with with the make-up of unconventional diatonic harmony.</p>
<p>For more info and for the special Rite of Spring micro-site, please visit <a href="http://riteofspring3d.thsh.co.uk/">http://riteofspring3d.thsh.co.uk</a></p>
<p><strong>Birmingham Contemporary Music Group &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>The BCMG is the city&#8217;s orchestra dedicated entirely to the performance of contemporary and new music. Made up of players from the CBSO, the flexible organisation has grown in the one of the world&#8217;s most fore-thinking ensembles of new music. They play regular concerts at the CBSO Centre on Berkley Street, B1, as well as touring all over the city.</p>
<p>The percussion players are performing what promises to be an excellent concert of Varese and Xenakis on the 25th March at Yardley Old Church as well as this Sunday (13th March).</p>
<p>Oliver Knussen conducts his own memorial work <em>Requiem &#8211; Songs for Sue</em> as well as pieces by Morton Feldman and Harrison Birtwistle</p>
<p><strong>Steve Reich and Thomas Ades. &#8211; <em>contemporary, classical</em></strong></p>
<p>This week, Friday 11th March, Symphony Hall have also included another excellent performance of contemporary. The London Sinfonietta, one of the world&#8217;s leading orchestra for contemporary classical music are visiting Birmingham, performing Steve<br />
Reich&#8217;s <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em>, complete with 4 grand pianos and 5 marimbas. The minimalist style of Steve Reich is used in many sources of media, films, adverts and television, purely for the fact it is accessible to both musician and audience alike. Conductor Thomas Ades? starts the concert with his own In Seven Days, a collaborative project with filmmaker Tal Rosner and is based on the Creation.</p>
<p>Tickets start from £10 (or £5 on the day for U25s)</p>
<p><strong>The Irrepressibles: Mirror Mirror<em> &#8211; contemporary pop, performance art, collaboration, crossover</em></strong></p>
<p>Another gig at the heart of Birmingham, the Town Hall, <em>The Irrepressibles</em> are a 10-piece orchestra committed to stretching the boundaries of conventional performance. Lead by singer, Jamie McDermot, they perform hearty indie music with a set up of orchestral musicians as accompaniment.</p>
<p>This show is in conjunction with Fierce Festival and is at Town Hall, 22nd March, £15</p>
<p><strong>SOUNDkitchen &#8211; <em>contemporary, sound, experimental, collaboration</em></strong></p>
<p>SOUNDkitchen is a new group made up of music graduates from the University of Birmingham. Their “STONEsoup” concert at the MAC was met with rave reviews and are following up with a collaborative event with Balkanic Eruption, promoters of Klezmer and Balkan music within the city. Playing at the Hare and Hounds, B14, the concert focuses on expanding sound using technology and live instruments, it will be followed by a live laptop performance from Garfield Benjamin.</p>
<p><a href="http://soundkitchenuk.org/500/balkan-fusion-hare-and-hounds"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9360" title="SOUNDkitchen" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KITCHEN_CT3-724x1024.jpg" alt="" width="415" height="587" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KITCHEN_CT3-724x1024.jpg 724w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/KITCHEN_CT3-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Birmingham Conservatoire &#8211; <em>classical contemporary, premieres, fusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Like the Uni of Birmingham, the Conservatoire has one of the most developed composition departments in the country. The students are exceptionally talented and lucky for us the concerts are generally very cheap and on a regular basis. This month as well as a student showcase of new music (held on the 18th March and conducted by the great Edwin Roxburgh) we see the <em>Frontiers</em> department of Conservatoire play host to world-renowned electronic violinist, Barbara Luneberg. This young talent has worked with some of the world&#8217;s best contemporary composers. On the 14th March, Luneberg is to perform works written for her by young composers from all over Europe, this will also include a premiere of work by VT of the Conservatoire, Ed Bennett.</p>
