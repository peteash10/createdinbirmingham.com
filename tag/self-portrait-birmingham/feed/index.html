				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="birmingham loves photographers" href="http://birminghamphotographers.tumblr.com/">Birmingham Loves Photographers</a> is still a very enjoyable blog. Which is a relief &#8211; I quite often get excited about a new face on the online scene, only for them to fizzle out after a couple of weeks (often when it turns out it was just a student&#8217;s university project).</p>
<p>Anyway, BLP is worth a subscribe/follow. They&#8217;ve been doing a good run of interviews with various photographers, have just released <a href="http://birminghamphotographers.tumblr.com/post/9555245871/birmingham-loves-photographers-portrait-project-round">the results of the first round of their Portrait Project</a> and they&#8217;ve also flagged up the <a href="http://birminghamphotographers.tumblr.com/post/9544380617/library-of-birmingham-self-portrait-1st-october">Library of Birmingham Self-Portrait</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the autumn of 2011, seven photographic sessions will take place in a range of locations – in the city centre and in community libraries across Birmingham, at which citizens will be invited to take self-portraits in a studio setting, using a shutter release and a plain backdrop. Participants will be given a copy of their photo to take away. The resulting images will be used in a digital installation in the new Library of Birmingham, with potential for a future publication project.</p></blockquote>
<p>It has it&#8217;s own website at <a title="Self Portrait Birmingham" href="http://www.selfportrait.org.uk/">Self Portrait Birmingham</a> but there&#8217;s no information there about this just yet, although BLP mention an event at Ward End Library on Saturday 1st October from 10.00am-4.00pm.</p>
<p>See also the <a title="Birmingham's People" href="http://www.birminghamphotospace.co.uk/events-and-competitions/birminghams-people-portraits-at-artsfest/">Birmingham&#8217;s People</a> project from a couple of years back.</p>
