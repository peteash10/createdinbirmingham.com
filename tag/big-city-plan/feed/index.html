<p>Spotted at <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/04/20/liveblog-creative-industries-election-debate/">last night&#8217;s creative industries debate</a> &#8211; <a href="http://birminghamartspartnership.co.uk/userfiles/file/cultural_capital-3.pdf">a document called Birmingham&#8217;s Cultural Capital</a> (PDF) and referred to by the Hippodrome&#8217;s Stuart Griffiths as Birmingham&#8217;s arts manifesto. Apparently it was produced in October 2009 and was produced by the <a href="http://www.birminghamartspartnership.co.uk/">Birmingham Arts Partnership</a>.</p>
<p>The BAP (who are presumably distinct from the Birmingham Cultural Partnership) includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Birmingham Hippodrome, Symphony Hall/Town Hall, The Drum, The Rep, Ikon,  Fierce, mac, Birmingham Royal                                  Ballet, City of Birmingham Symphony  Orchestra, Birmingham Opera Company, sampad and Birmingham Contemporary  Music Group</p></blockquote>
<p>Their aims are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To work with key partners in the city and region to ensure that culture plays a central part in the development agenda for Birmingham</li>
<li>To support and strengthen the brand recognition and ranking of Birmingham as a culturally rich regional capital</li>
<li>To ensure high and growing levels of participation and engagement in culture and the resultant flow of intangible personal, social and societal benefits throughout the city</li>
<li>To demonstrate to policy-makers and decision-influencers that investment in culture brings significant regenerative benefits</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s an explanation of how that&#8217;s going to work but it&#8217;s the standard arts measurement/engagement/excellence waffle so I&#8217;ll spare you.</p>
<p>Other than a statement of intent, what can BAP be credited with thus far? There are two things that I can find:</p>
<ul>
<li>a commissioned <a href="http://birminghamartspartnership.co.uk/userfiles/file/Cultural%20Impact%20Study.pdf">Cultural Impact Study on the impact of the arts in Birmingham</a> (PDF) from Sept 09 which, having skimmed though it, seems to set out the terms for BAP&#8217;s engagement but also looks suspiciously like an exercise in stating the bleeding obvious (culture is good, etc)</li>
<li>a <a href="http://consult.birmingham.gov.uk/portal/ps/birmingham_big_city_plan/bcpwip?&amp;page=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;pointId=copy_511273_ID_15&amp;do=view"> response to the Big City Plan</a> back in Feb 09</li>
</ul>
<p>Worth a skim through if you&#8217;ve got the time and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what comes of it all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lisa and Jenny from Capsule <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/2008/12/my-advice-to-birmingham/">gave their thoughts on the Big City Plan to Night Times Newspaper</a>, concentrating on the development of Digbeth. Here&#8217;s what they said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently our success has happened in spite of the city rather than because of it,ÃÂ  just think what could be achieved if we worked together.ÃÂ  Travelling frequently to other cities these are some suggestions to make Digbeth blossom as a cultural quarter:</p>
<ul>
<li> Why do people get on planes and trains to come to Supersonic Ã¢â¬â because we offer them a totally unique experience of the highest quality.ÃÂ  There is a real opportunity to acknowledge what makes Birmingham a unique city and invest in independent and niche activity.ÃÂ  Steer clear of a homogenised approach Ã¢â¬â learn from those that do it well and have a track record.</li>
<li> Lets learn from other cities like Berlin, Glasgow and Manchester and take risks with our empty buildings Ã¢â¬â an opportunity to invest in content to be housed in these empty spaces to animate the area, lets not be so precious i.e. noise restrictions Ã¢â¬â creativity is often loud and messy lets embrace and celebrate this.</li>
<li> Encourage more creative companies to have the opportunity to be able to buy their own buildings rather than be tied to short-term leases.</li>
<li> Create flexible spaces that can house a variety of activity which changes from week to week, this will keep the area vibrant.</li>
<li> DonÃ¢â¬â¢t just invest in a couple of landlords this creates a monopoly.</li>
<li> Lets get the basics right Ã¢â¬â look at infrastructure: cash points, post offices, signage, and streetlights.</li>
<li> Think about the visitors experience as well as what its like to work in this area, lets make it the highest quality experience Ã¢â¬â currently feels like quite an intimidating, unfriendly area.</li>
<li> Creative quarters need to grow organically, invest in supporting growth rather than imposing structured ideas of what you think creativity should be.</li>
<li> Remember areas develop over time not over night.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Shona McQuillan (<a href="http://graphiquillan.wordpress.com/">Graphiquillan</a>) has thrown in her 2p on &#8216;the recent stirrings&#8217; and ends with what she calls &#8216;The Break Free Manifesto&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<blockquote>
<li><a href="http://graphiquillan.wordpress.com/2008/09/10/finding-the-creative-needles-in-birminghams-haystack/">No logo</a></li>
<li> Evolution is imperative and the need for it must be acknowledged and respected by official bodies.</li>
<li> ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not about self-interest &#8211; it embraces all who trade, visit, consume or adore. It brings elements together where it makes sense to do so &#8211; itÃ¢â¬â¢s more about healthy benevolence, but allows those who should benefit to do so.</li>
<li> ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not about the establishment. It recognises many forms of creativity: art, music, dance, theatre, multimedia, skate culture, tattoos, grafitti et al.</li>
<li> It recognises that the stateÃ¢â¬â¢s not going to do this and that those most qualified to do so, the cityÃ¢â¬â¢s creatives, are the leads on this.</li>
<p>Break free. Time to do it ourselves?</p></blockquote>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>On Thursday evening last week, <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk">Creative Republic</a> brought together council leader Mike Whitby and head of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, Jerry Blackett to discuss the role of Birmingham&#8217;s creative industries in the <a href="http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/">Big City Plan</a>.ÃÂ  Mark Ball (at the lecturn in the pic) hosted.</p>
<p>Rhubarb Radio were there to record the proceedings and have a link to <a href="http://rhubarbradio.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/creative-industries-and-birminghams-big-city-plan/">an audio file of the speeches</a><a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/60406280/e232c85e/Main_Speeches.html"></a>.ÃÂ  There are some photos in the <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/image/tid/19">gallery on the Creative Republic site</a> and here are <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/4962631/Big-City-Plan">Pete Aston&#8217;s notes in mindmap form</a>.</p>
<p>What I took away from the evening was that nothing&#8217;s yet set in stone and there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done on developing the plan.</p>
<p>The thing is, things are currently at the talking stage.ÃÂ  It&#8217;s hard to get a sense of what direction things are taking as there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything we can really get our teeth into, dissect and inspect.ÃÂ  I think I remember Mike Whitby saying that there might be something more tangible to look at in October.ÃÂ  A follow-up event is in the offing.</p>
<p>The other thing that was impressed upon us all is that, in terms of employees and Gross Value Added, the creative sector is comparable in size to the city&#8217;s lauded financial sector.ÃÂ  There&#8217;s a lot of latent power there that could influence the way the city develops.</p>
<p>We were told that if anyone wants to get involved in shaping the plan then there&#8217;s no need to wait for an invite.ÃÂ  Unfortunately the mechanism for getting involved isn&#8217;t that clear, although according to the Big City Plan site, Richard Healy is the initial point of contact for anyone wanting to get in touch.ÃÂ  You can call him on 0121 303 3075 or email <a href="mailto:richard.healy@birmingham.gov.uk">richard.healy@birmingham.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Helga Henry from Creative Republic said that they would be asking everyone who was there to submit one big idea for Birmingham.ÃÂ  They&#8217;ll be collected together and presented to the Big City Plan peeps.</p>
<p>To feed into that, and perhaps addressing anyone who hasn&#8217;t signed up to the <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/charter">Creative Republic charter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What&#8217;s your big idea for Birmingham?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Whack it in the comments and it&#8217;ll be thrown into the mix.ÃÂ  I&#8217;ll start things off&#8230;</p>
