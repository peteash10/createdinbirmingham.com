				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hockley Flyer and YBA Publications are holding a competition to find the best photograph for the front cover of the new magazine; Historic Jewellery Quarter. This is a brand new magazine which hopes to give an insight into the Jewellery Quarter&#8217;s past.</p>
<p>They are looking for a photograph that captures the very essence of the Jewellery Quarter and its heritage. Perhaps a photo of a typical jewellers or silversmiths workshop? Past or present photographs are welcome!</p>
<p>I spoke to the guys down at the Jewellery Quarter Heritage who gave me some background and also an idea of what they are looking for&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>The Hockley Flyer magazine has been published by us for nearly a quarter of a century and we also published the first (and second) History &amp; Guide to The Jewellery Quarter over 20 years ago, which is almost sold out. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>During that time we have accumulated over one thousand items on the history of the Quarter – far too much to publish as a ‘book’ so we decided to publish a quarterly magazine ‘Jewellery Quarter Heritage’ which will hopefully run for several years. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>What we are always short of is photographs, some that we do have cannot be reproduced good enough for a magazine cover. </em></strong><strong><em>That is what the competition is about &#8211; to obtain pics of ‘existing workshops’ in their ‘real working state’.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To enter simply email the photograph(s) with your name and address or use the form available <a title="Photographic Competition" href="http://www.thehockleyflyer.info/?p=6551" target="_blank">here</a>. Please be sure to read the terms &amp; conditions and note that entries not chosen may be used in future issues of the magazine. The competition winner will win a subscription to the first four issues of the magazine, and will hopefully be announced at the launch on 6th September at Vertu Bar.</p>

<p>Read down &#8211; there&#8217;s a competition for free tickets later on in this post.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m conscious that I&#8217;ve not mentioned <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a> so much on here over the past month. Partly that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been busy working on it and going to just about every event that I could.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only a couple of days left but still a chance to catch some good stuff. Tonight, there&#8217;s:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/cruel">Cruel by Companhia de Dança Deborah Colker</a> (Birmingham Hippodrome)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/self-unfinished">Self Unfinished by Xavier Le Roy</a> (Ikon Eastside)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/kathak-duet">Kathak Duet by Abhimanyu &amp; Vidha Lal</a> (The Patrick Centre)</li>
</ul>
<p>And tomorrow (the last day) there&#8217;s:</p>
<ul>
<li>A second chance to catch <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/cruel">Cruel</a> (Birmingham Hippodrome)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/put-your-foot-down">Put Your Foot Down</a> (St Martin&#8217;s Square, Bullring)</li>
</ul>
<p>Put Your Foot Down is a big, free event that&#8217;ll run from midday to 6pm. Worth checking out, because the festival has been doing big, free public events very well (for instance, <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/news/2010/05/09/remembering-utopia/">Utopia was great</a>).</p>
<p>I saw Self Unfinished at Ikon Eastside last night and it&#8217;s probably the most &#8216;out there&#8217; event in the entire programme &#8211; as David Massingham (festival co-director) said afterwards, it&#8217;s probably the furthest you can get from Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to Cruel tonight though &#8211; athletic Brazilian dancers, knives, spinning mirrors and a ruddy great big globe-shaped chandelier. That&#8217;s entertainment. Speaking of which&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been given a pair of tickets for the spectacular-looking <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/cruel">Cruel</a> tonight. If you want your name to go into a draw for them then email &#8216;CRUEL&#8217; to <a href="emailto:createdinbirmingham@gmail.com">createdinbirmingham@gmail.com</a>. We&#8217;ll do the draw at about 2pm and let the winner know the good news.</p>

<p>I have two reasons for posting this:</p>

<li>It amused me that the site talks up &#8216;free entry to the splendid Birmingham Artsfest&#8217; when entry is free anyway</li>
<li>It&#8217;s good to see Birmingham being talked about as a destination for an arty getaway</li>

<p>Elsewhere on the site there&#8217;s a good <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/urbanundiscovered/studio4">profile of Studio 4</a> and mentions given to the Outcrowd Collective, Them Lot, Capsule, Beat13 and Fluid&#8217;s Lee Basford. &#8216;Log&#8217; Roper from Studio4 &#8216;paints a rosy picture of a thriving, supportive scene, where musicians and artists intermingle&#8217;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/king-idomeneo1.jpg" rel="lightbox[1935]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1936" title="king-idomeneo" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/king-idomeneo1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="242" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/king-idomeneo1.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/king-idomeneo1-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>I went to the full dress rehearsal of Birmingham Opera Company&#8217;s King Idomeneo on Sunday night and loved it. What&#8217;s not to like about an abandoned factory stuffed with shipping containers, opera singers, dirt and orange trees?</p>
<p>Anyway, I have two tickets for tonight&#8217;s proper opening show to give away to the first person who shouts up for them in the comments.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>No-one associated with CiB (that includes Creative Republic types) can claim the tickets</li>
<li>First to claim the tickets in the comments wins</li>
<li>But feel free to stake a claim after the first post, just in case (see below)</li>
<li>I need to give your real name to the ticket-giving people.Â  If you post under a pseudonym then remember to use a real email address.Â  If I you don&#8217;t reply to a confirmatory email quick enough and/or I think you&#8217;re messing about I&#8217;ll work my way down the list of commenters</li>
<li>Tickets are to be collected on the door no later than 6.30pm today, 12 August 2008 &#8211; don&#8217;t claim them if you can&#8217;t make it (it sounds obvious but&#8230;)</li>
<li>My decision on anything and everything is final</li>
</ul>
<p>If whoever goes would be good enough to blog about the show or send me a review to post on CiB that&#8217;d be great.Â  Not essential or anything but it&#8217;d be nice.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t win the tickets then maybe consider buying one and going along anyway.Â  You&#8217;re not likely to get the chance to see anything like this for a while.</p>
<p>Finally, the Birmingham Post&#8217;s photographer was there on Sunday so you can <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/news-gallery/2008/08/11/birmingham-opera-company-s-king-idomeneo-65233-21513888/">see some pics to get an idea of what it was all about</a>.Â  There&#8217;s more info in <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/08/05/more-info-on-king-idomeneo-and-free-dress-rehearsal/">my last post about it</a> and on the <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/">Birmingham Opera Company website</a>.</p>
