				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://soundsfriendly.wordpress.com/">Sounds Friendly</a> are not for profit promoters of live music based in the  West Midlands. They&#8217;re bringing some tunes to the CiB Shop over the next few weeks <strong>starting tomorrow</strong> (Wednesday) so come on down or wander over after work.</p>
<p>Here are the descriptions we&#8217;ve been given for what&#8217;s planned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Weds 14th April<br />
5.30-6.30pm<br />
A Touch of Klez</p>
<p>One of the many smaller groups born from the primordial soup of talent  that is the 40-strong Birmingham Conservatoire Folk Ensemble, A Touch of  Klez is klezmer with a twist. Led by clarinettist Katie Stevens, and  featuring violin and (unusually) cello, expect an improvised whirl of  Yiddish rhythm that&#8217;s sure to get your toes tapping.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
Weds 21st April<br />
Tbc&#8230;(Watch this space)<br />
5.30-6.30pm<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
Weds 28th April<br />
5.30-6.30pm<br />
Lluis Mather Trio</p>
<p>Led by talented young saxophonist and composer Lluis Mather, one of the  most promising performers produced by the renowned jazz performance  course at Birmingham Conservatoire, this trio showcases the seductive  voice of Holly Thomas and inventive pianist Matt Radcliffe. Forthcoming  gigs for Lluis include a set at the Barclays Cheltenham Jazz Festival  2010, and obviously, playing in the best shop in the Bullring.</p></blockquote>

<p>As far as the <a href="http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk">Big City Plan</a> is concerned, so far there&#8217;s been plenty to talk about but nothing in writing to pick apart. <a href="http://birminghamcentral.blogspot.com/2008/11/big-city-plan-3.html">Birmingham Central</a> have picked out highlights of the</p>

<p>There follows multitudinous charts, maps and options. Worth a read if you&#8217;re interested in what&#8217;s being planned. (<a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=5915"><em>via D&#8217;log</em></a>)</p>
<p>In fact, if that floats your boat then you might be interested in the next Creative Republic event.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ll have to excuse some slightly hectic posting this week and next while I get my head round 300ish new RSS feeds and an inbox stuffed with interesting (and hopefully not yet out of date) emails.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also introduce myself properly later but for now, here&#8217;s a round-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">aCtiVe arts</a> is a steering group, made up of committed residents and local professionals, dedicated to providing quality arts experiences and opportunities for the Castle Vale community of North-East Birmingham&#8221;.  They have <a href="http://activearts.wordpress.com/">a blog</a> and you are advised to see what they&#8217;re doing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next <a href="http://www.dropbeatsnotbombs.co.uk/">Drop Beats Not Bombs</a> runs from Friday 2 to Monday 5 May (the bank holiday) and tickets are available.  That&#8217;s at The Rainbow (and the warehouse and arches) in Digbeth.  There should be more info on their website but it was having bandwidth issues last I checked.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The people at the <a href="http://www.thepeopleshop.co.uk/">People</a> shop in Kings Heath are having a party with drinks and canapÃ©s at their store on Saturday 26th April from 10am until 5:30pm.  It&#8217;s in aid of Macmillan, there&#8217;s a raffle for a luxury goodie bag and visitors can have their photo taken by <a href="http://www.emilyquinton.com/">Emily Quinton</a>. Get all the info <a href="http://thepeopleshop.co.uk/index.php?main_page=fundraising">here</a>.Â  **UPDATE** It was a big success with Â£430 raised on the day.Â  More events will follow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simon has started a blog called <a href="http://birminghamcentral.blogspot.com/">Birmingham Central</a>.  He says he&#8217;s &#8220;been inspired by the recent blogging epidemic sweeping Birmingham and the value of a good blog to share news and information&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of bloggers, the next Birmingham Bloggers meet-up will be on Tuesday 29 April at Rooty Frooty in the Custard Factory.  <a href="http://www.podnosh.com/blog/2008/04/22/birminghambloggersmeet4/">Nick Booth</a> has more info but I refer you also to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=12243583846">Facebook event</a> and the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/495801/">Upcoming</a> page.</li>
</ul>
