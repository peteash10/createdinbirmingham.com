Not sure this has been linked to from here &#8211; a list of women who have made a significant contribution to Birmingham</li>
<li><a href="http://artsnationwestmidlands.co.uk/">Arts Nation West Midlands</a><br />
&#8220;The Arts Nation West Midlands project is an Arts Council England West Midlands funded initiative, developed and delivered by Audiences Central, that aims to address the national priority of Public Engagement in 2010/11 and beyond&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://neversaymusic.wordpress.com/">Never Say</a><br />
&#8220;Being based in Birmingham, I have seen the creation of a genuine music scene being built with many fantastic, hardworking and honest people being at the fundamental heart of it. I will write about shows and events taking place in this city which I feel don’t get credit they deserve&#8221;</li>

&#8220;Ok folks we’re experimenting with this new technology malarky and so as well as finding our latest zine at our shows and in selected places in Brum you can now read it online&#8221;</li>

<p><a href="http://www.kirstydavies.co.uk/">Kirsty Davies</a> got in touch the other week. I asked for a little bit of information about herself and this is what she said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After finishing a HND in jewellery and silversmithing I went on to work with a jewellery and manufacturing company within the jewellery quarter for 3 and half years. From there I went onto completing in degree in jewellery design gaining first class honours.</p>
<p>I have now set up a jewellery and accessory company under my name Kirsty Davies.</p>
<p>My aim as a designer is to create items that are inspired but not dictated to by fashion by creating beautifully different pieces.</p>
<p>My products are fresh, fun and exciting and as well as using precious materials, experiment with unconventional materials such as neoprene usually reserved for wetsuits.</p>
<p>An exciting piece I that I’m launching for spring summer is the make it, wear it, love it neoprene jewellery accessory, which is assembled by the consumer and customised as a corsage, necklace, head piece, bag accessory….the list goes on.</p></blockquote>
