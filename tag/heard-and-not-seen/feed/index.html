<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.heardandnotseen.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-5987 aligncenter" title="Hans_01_pr" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Hans_01_pr.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="131" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Hans_01_pr.jpg 510w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Hans_01_pr-300x70.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s what the project&#8217;s website has to say about it all:</p>
<blockquote><p>The project aims to create a unique, safe space for people to meet and  ask questions with each other, of each other; particularly about faith,  religion and spirituality.</p>
<p>There is a clear need for ordinary people to discuss, express and  enquire about aspects of daily Muslim and religious life in response to  the climate of polarised media reporting.</p>
<p>Visitors will be invited to interact with the installation that  consists of a series of freestanding sculptures, photographs and  projections.  The exhibition contents were generated from community  workshops and invites audiences to ask and explore.</p></blockquote>
<p>For more information on the project, which runs from 10th July to 22nd August, <a href="http://www.heardandnotseen.com/newsblog/">check out the Heard and Not Seen website here</a>.</p>
