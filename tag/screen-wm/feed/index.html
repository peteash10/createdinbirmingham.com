				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d post my response to an email I received from someone the other day. The emailer said (and these are a couple of extracts):</p>
<blockquote><p>I am currently looking for creative projects to get involved with in the Birmingham area, specifically film or media based projects. I have lots of transferable skills through studying film on my course and I am looking for possible work experience (unpaid) in TV, film or any kind of production, as a runner, film grip and/or any position where the skills I have may come in useful.</p>
<p>My biggest focus is finding opportunities, getting out there and getting involved in anything I can, from possible collaborations to arts events, workshops, anything to keep me busy and anything that allows me to be creative and continues the type of work I was doing on my course.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of anything specific but gave a few starting places. I operate on the assumption that CiB readers know much more than I do, so if anyone can add anything then please do in the comments. My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any specific opportunities at the moment. It&#8217;s a bit of a funny time for that kind of thing at the moment, what with Screen WM (who used to put on events and so on) closing down a few months back and Creative England (the body taking their place) only just getting up and running. In the meantime it might be worth looking at <a href="http://www.bsin.co.uk/">http://www.bsin.co.uk/</a> and seeing what they&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p>Also, have a look at these events, get yourself along and see who you meet:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.producersforum.org.uk/">http://www.producersforum.org.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/">http://www.creativenetworksonline.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.birminghamsmc.com/">http://www.birminghamsmc.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.helloculture.net/">http://www.helloculture.net/</a> (this is on tomorrow)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Maybe see what courses are happening at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/ ">http://www.macarts.co.uk/</a> or <a href="http://light-house.co.uk/">http://light-house.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the closure of the Creative Partnerships Programme, <a title="Bright Space" href="http://www.brightspace.org.uk/">Bright Space</a> announced that they would be closing. Today&#8217;s their last day.</p>
<p>This from <a title="Stan's Cafe" href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1832">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s sad because Brightspace were behind a huge number of inspirational projects that took artists into schools to work creatively with students and teachers. Now, despite a great report from OFSTED setting out the great value of these projects, the plug as been pulled, the axe has fallen, the bubble burst, the goose cooked, the turkey plucked, the swan sung and the full stopped.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d lost track of what&#8217;s happening with <a title="Creative England" href="http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/">Creative England</a> &#8211; I thought it was going to be based on a partnership of all the screen agencies <a href="http://www.rewiredpr.com/news/entry/screen_wm_brings_curtain_down_as_creative_england_takes_on_support_role/">but here&#8217;s a press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday 30th September 2011, regional screen agency Screen WM will bring the curtain down on nine years of support for the screen media industries in the West Midlands and welcome Creative England as the new umbrella body for the creative sector.</p>
<p>The closure of <a title="Screen WM" href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Screen WM</a> follows the coalition government’s decision to replace the <a title="UK Film Council" href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/" target="_blank">UK Film Council’s</a> support for film-making, which core-funded the regional screen agencies, with funding through the British Film Institute.</p></blockquote>
<p>All the best to the folks working at these organisations who are moving on.</p>
<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m predicting a few more posts like this over the next few months.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merry Christmas from one and all at Created in Birmingham!</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;d be surprised if anyone is reading this (and to be even more honest, I wrote this a few days back anyway) but, in case it&#8217;s timely, here are a few things on TV that you might be interested in today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birmingham Royal Ballet&#8217;s <em>Cinderella</em>, BBC2 at 3pm</li>
<li>Best of European Opera 2010 (ft Birmingham Opera Company&#8217;s <em>Othello</em>), BBC4 at 7pm</li>
</ul>
<p>Screen WM have done <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/news/detail/1222/screen_wm_supported_projects_including_toast_nativity_hustle_and_more_this_christmas_and_new_year/">a round-up of the festive stuff they&#8217;ve been involved in</a>, including The Brothers McLeod&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.brothersmcleod.co.uk/posts/show/48">The Moon Bird</a></em> (Christmas Day, 12.40am on Channel 4 &#8211; oh, bit late for that, sorry), the new series of <em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x2yj7">Upstairs Downstairs</a></em> (Boxing Day, 9pm on BBC 1), <a href="http://www.nigelslater.com/tv.asp"><em>Toast</em></a> (30 December, 9pm on BBC 1) and, later on in January, the return of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/hustle/"><em>Hustle</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got some vouchers burning a hole in your pocket then <a href="http://www.soulboythefilm.com/">Soulboy</a> and <a href="http://www.nativitythemovie.co.uk/">Nativity</a> are out on DVD.</p>
<p>On the radio side of things, Robin Valk&#8217;s <a href="http://radiotogo.blogspot.com/2010/10/handsworth-evolution-documentary.html">Handsworth Evolution</a> will be played on 30 December on BBC WM.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Conservative Party Conference starts tomorrow, so expect a fair amount of disruption around the city centre &#8211; especially the city end of Broad Street around the ICC and Symphony Hall.</p>
<p>Travel advice aside, arts and culture will be getting a foot in the door a few times over the duration, including this lot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jonathan Watkins (Director of <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/">Ikon Gallery</a>) has been invited by <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/jeremy_hunt/south_west_surrey">Jeremy Hunt MP</a> to speak on Sunday. His speech will apparently &#8220;highlight the cultural wealth of Birmingham and promote Ikon&#8217;s ambition for the creation of a new museum of modern art in the city&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk/">Screen WM</a> are putting on a fringe event called <a href="http://cityasaplatform.eventbrite.com/">City as a Platform</a> (reminiscent of the much-referenced, lesser read <a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2008/02/the-street-as-p.html">Dan Hill post</a>) on Monday</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/edward_vaizey/wantage">Ed Vaizey MP</a> will be off and about on Monday. He&#8217;ll be officially opening <a href="http://www.zellig.co.uk/">Zellig</a> and later on checking out <a href="http://www.skillset.org/uk/westmids/further/article_4923_1.asp">BCU&#8217;s Skillset Media Academy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk/">Rosie Kay Dance Company</a> will be <a href="http://www.dance-ground.com/2010/09/scoring-points-for-style-at.html">performing Double Points: K</a> at the Symphony Hall on Tuesday</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more happening too, but those are the ones I&#8217;ve come across.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been invited, with a bunch of other local bloggers, to go and meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeeda_Warsi,_Baroness_Warsi">Sayeeda Warsi</a> (Co-Chairman of the Conservative Party and Cabinet Minister without portfolio) and <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/andrew_mitchell/sutton_coldfield">Andrew Mitchell</a> (MP for Sutton Coldfield and Secretary of State for International Development) later today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The good news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Screen WM&#8217;s 2010/11 Investment Fund opens on Tuesday 4 May 2010</p></blockquote>
<p>The bad news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Screen WM is also announcing that the UK Film Council has now  confirmed a significant reduction of Lottery funding to each of the nine  regional screen agencies. They are also reallocating all skills and  training funding previously distributed through the regional screen  agencies to Skillset. Skillset will now handle all applications for  skills and training funding, to apply visit <a href="http://www.skillset.org/"><strong>www.skillset.org</strong></a> .  Screen WM will continue to work closely with Skillset to ensure a smooth  transition of skills funding in the region.</p>
<p>[&#8230;] there is a total cut of 25% to Screen WM&#8217;s  2010/11 Lottery funding from the UK Film Council</p>
<p>[&#8230;] the impact of these cuts mean that inevitably there is an overall  reduction in Lottery funding available in our 2010/11 Investment Fund.  This means that Screen WM will be funding fewer projects in total in  comparison with previous years and the application process this year  will undoubtedly be more competitive. As such, Screen WM has taken the  decision to be more targeted in approach and provide more specific  support to projects</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result, <a href="http://www.screenwm.co.uk">Screen WM</a> will specifically be investing in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Film and Media Education &#8216;Hubs&#8217;</li>
<li>Film Festivals</li>
<li>Film Script Development</li>
<li>Regional Film Industry support networks</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping posts like this don&#8217;t become too commonplace. Fuller info over at <a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/news/?id=811">Audiences Central</a>.</p>
