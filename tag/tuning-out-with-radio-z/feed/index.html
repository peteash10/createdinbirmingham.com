				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re taking a bit of a break here but CiB will return in the new year. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll be posting a few &#8216;year in review&#8217; things to remind you that 2010 was alright really, and that all the talk of (and worrying over) money over recent months shouldn&#8217;t detract from some great art, work and artworks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just to show how 2010 looked on Created in Birmingham, we published 649 blog posts and attracted 578 comments, garnering 222,264 pageviews from 81,937 unique (like snowflakes) visitors. There was also 1 shop that took £45,000, with most of that money going to the artists themselves.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months we&#8217;ve also had <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/cib-supporters/">40 CiB supporters</a> and a handful of advertisers &#8211; a big thank you goes out to them for helping us to keep the site going.</p>
<p>These were the 10 most popular posts published this year:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not really one for doing &#8216;best of&#8217;s but (off the top of my head) it was good to see <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">the MAC</a> reopening, I liked the Steve McCurry retrospective at BMAG and <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/458/the_body_electric/">Len Lye at Ikon</a> (which is still on), <a href="http://www.befestival.org/">Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> was fun and I enjoyed a load of things at <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a>.</p>
<p>Odd but great moments included &#8216;sleeping&#8217; on stage during <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a>&#8216;s <em>Tuning Out with Radio Z</em> (which <a href="http://www.chrisunitt.co.uk/2010/05/last-night-i-couldnt-sleep/">I&#8217;ve written about here</a>) and, of course, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/bullring-shop/">That Shop</a>.</p>
<p>There was plenty more besides and far too many things I wish I&#8217;d seen but didn&#8217;t. I suppose I&#8217;ll just have to try to see more next year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/page/3649/performance/22">mac</a> have commissioned some new <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/tuningoutwithradioz/index.html">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a> which is being performed there from Thurs to Sat and then touring later in the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://radioz.co.uk/">Tuning Out with Radio Z</a> is best described by they themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>The hosts of the night time show <strong>Tuning Out</strong> know all  about facing down the void. Each night they start the show blank, with  nothing planned, armed with just a stack of charity shop records and six  hours in which to calm the world’s chaos and settle its people down to  sleep.</p>
<p>This is a theatre show, which is also a radio show. You can listen to <strong>Tuning  Out</strong> at home on-line via our website but true excitement comes  when you visit its extraordinary studio in the theatre and become privy  to presenter’s deeply compromised off-mic World.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://radioz.co.uk/">Radio Z website</a>. You can sign in to the <a href="http://www.radioz.co.uk/news">News Room</a> bit and, during the performance,  interact with things, send messages and so on.</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be a pre-show talk with James Yarker at 6pm on the Friday to discuss the show. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the development of this show had something to do (at least in part) with <a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/24hourscalextric/index.html">commentating on a Scalextric race for 24 hours</a> last year, but you never can tell.</p>
