This is kinda sad but hopefully it can find a good home. Also, at £5k this should&#8217;ve sold already</li>

It&#8217;s technically their last day tomorrow but their pub-based send off was last night. Good luck to everyone who&#8217;s moving on. For now: &#8220;This website is part of the legacy for Audiences Central, the regional audience development agency for the West Midlands (2004-2012)&#8221; The links page is very useful</li>

Hello. I hadn&#8217;t spotted this before: &#8220;All About Audiences will be managing a contract from Warwickshire County Council previously delivered by Audiences Central to coordinate audience development support in the county during 2012/13&#8221;</li>

The Rep. They want your food stories.</li>

Sad to hear this from Emma. Insure your stuff and back up your computers people &#8211; there are bad people about</li>

The VIVID Pod prototype is arguably the first manufactured, mobile artist’s space in the UK. The pod concept was developed by architect Ranbir Lal in collaboration with VIVID in response to VIVID&#8217;s artist research programme; it explores the possibilities of integrating production within an exhibition environment.</li>

<p>The gently upbeat <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/">BiNS</a> makes me happy. It&#8217;s run by someone for no money (and sometimes fewer thanks) by someone with a palpable affection for their city.</p>
<p><a title="Forward" href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/forward">Forward</a> is a council-sponsored propaganda rag with plenty of &#8216;good news&#8217; but no personality and even less credibility. If it wasn&#8217;t foisted on every household in the city I doubt anyone would ask for it. I almost feel sorry for the thing. </p>
<p>By all means stick the latter on the web and call it #Birmighamproudtobeabrummie (sic). I know which I&#8217;d rather read.</p>

<p>Just a quick round up of everything going on this weekend, there&#8217;s a lot and we wouldn&#8217;t want you to forget and miss out on anything!</p>
<p><strong>Cum Clubbing</strong> &#8211; Hosted by <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>,  this art party does not look like something to be missed (although it&#8217;s happening now, so get down quick). From 8pm &#8211;  late, VIVID&#8217;s project space will be taken over by live music, DJs and  visual artists who&#8217;ll conspire to create an excitingly strange evening  of camp disco. Tickets are £5.</p>
<p>To  save time I&#8217;m going to be both lazy and efficient, and link you to  everyone else who&#8217;s been talking about this. Take a look at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2010/09/cum-clubbing-at-vivid-this-saturday-10th-september/">Digbeth is Good</a>, <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/cum-clubbing/">More Canals than Venice</a>, <a href="http://brianduffyhasabigbrain.com/post/1003304250/cum-clubbing-for-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an">brianduffyhasabigbrain</a>, and <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2010/08/cum-clubbing%E2%80%9Cfor-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an-art.html">Birmingham: It&#8217;s Not Shit</a>.</p>
