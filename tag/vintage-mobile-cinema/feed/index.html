				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack</a> and <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org">Fierce</a> have barely begun, but I&#8217;ve already been taking a sneak peek of a few of the things they&#8217;ve got going on, including <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing Room</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> and a trip over to the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/events/?venue=the-dirty-end">Dirty End</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9494" title="symphony of a missing room" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="385" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony.jpg 605w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/symphony-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yesterday morning I headed over to <a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a>, for a visit unlike any other. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room"><em>Symphony of a Missing</em> Room by Lundahl &amp; Seitl</a>, feeling slightly apprehensive as I was given a pair of wireless headphones, blindfolded and led cautiously around the museum by sounds, voices and a mysterious hand. The whole experience was what I can only describe as dream like, and had me leaving feeling like I&#8217;d been awoken from a deep, disorienting sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far it&#8217;s been receiving plenty of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/symphony%20of%20a%20missing%20room">rave reviews on Twitter</a>, who all seem to be able to put the experience into words so much better than I can. If you want to check it out for yourself, <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/fierce-festival/whats-on/symphony-of-a-missing-room">book via the Fierce website</a>, it&#8217;s definitely one to give a go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last night also saw the launch of both Flatpack and Fierce, at <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>, which has been transformed into The Dirty End. Along with live music from <a href="http://www.juneauprojects.co.uk/">Juneau Projects</a>, they had a few tasty treats and cocktails on offer which will apparently be sticking around for most of the festival.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vintagemobilecinema.co.uk/">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> had it&#8217;s first Flatpack outing this afternoon in Victoria Square, where it gathered quite a few admirers. The 22 seater restored mobile cinema, originally toured British factories from 1967, promoting modern production methods. As one of only seven made, this gem is the last standing after being brought back to life to tour the country once again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9493" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9887-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With it&#8217;s cosy little interior, complete with red cinema seats, it feels rather like a mini <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/">Electric</a>. I was also treated to a clip of Buster Keaton&#8217;s silent film <em>Sherlock Junior</em> (1924), which is being screening tomorrow night at the <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/view/an-evening-of-silent-film-and-live-music">Town Hall</a>, accompanied by live organ and piano.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916.jpg" rel="lightbox[9492]"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9495" title="Vintage Mobile Cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9916-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>If you fancy hopping aboard, the vintage mobile cinema will be at Handsworth Library on Thursday, Birmingham Markets on Saturday, and Cannon Hill Park on Sunday. Take a look at whats on across the weekend over on the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/event/vintage-mobile-cinema">Flatpack site</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and update this post with other Flatpack &amp; Fierce adventures, but in the meantime let us know which events you&#8217;ve made it to and what should be on our &#8216;must see&#8217; lists.</p>

<p>So news of next years <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org">Flatpack Festival</a> has arrived, and it looks like there are a few treats in store. Along with their usual eclectic mix of film, animation, prize-winning documentaries, multi-media performance and interactive projections, they&#8217;re got a few novelties up their sleves.</p>
<p>The promise of a 22 seater vintage mobile cinema, a Friday night Drive-In, live scores and late night parties sounds like a pretty exciting prospect to me.</p>
<p>Personally i&#8217;m looking forward to catching this perfectly restored 1960&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vintagemobilecinema.co.uk/">Vintage Mobile Cinema</a> which will be touring the city screening a range of shorts, home-movies and archive clips.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/blog/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8400" title="flatpack vintage mobile cinema" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/VMC.jpg" alt="flatpack vintage mobile cinema" width="396" height="297" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/VMC.jpg 495w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/VMC-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Following the success of this years <strong>Invisible Cinema</strong> tour of original 1930s art deco Odeons, 2011 will uncover more of Birmingham&#8217;s finest cinema heritage, including ex-picturehouses and forgotten celluloid landmarks. They also have an exhibition of images from disused cinemas planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s a few other things they&#8217;ve got lined up;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Prostitute</strong> &#8211; on the eve of its re-release, <a href="http://www.tonygarnett.com">Tony Garnett</a> revisits his 1980 drama <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164142/">Prostitute</a>, partly shot in Balsall Heath, a few years before community action shut down the local red light district.</p>
<p><strong>Loft in Translation</strong> – screenings in partnership with MACE’s Full Circle project, which encourages people to retrieve home-movies from their attics.</p>
<p><strong>Archive Revival </strong>&#8211; Artists and filmmakers who appropriate and repurpose archive material including work by Thom Andersen, Duncan Campbell and Peter Tscherkassky.</p>
<p><strong>Other confirmations</strong> – 1992 video diary In Bed With Chris Needham, a vivid snapshot of an adolescent metalhead in Loughborough; the UK premiere of Shadow Shows, an experiment in surreal horror created by Pram and Film Ficciones; and Every Minute Always, an immersive sound piece using headsets in a cinema, inspired by Brief Encounter.</p></blockquote>
<p>The full programme will be announced in February 2011, so keep an eye on their <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org">website</a> and <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/blog">blog</a> for more updates.</p>
