				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://peteashton.com/">Pete Ashton</a>, who occasionally still pops up around these parts and is looking into bringing the CiB Shop back, has announced a couple of notable things.</p>
<p>First up, he&#8217;s resurrecting the social media surgeries that he used to run out of Rootys a couple of years ago. £20 will buy you half an hour to pick his brains, which should give you plenty of time to learn a shedload about how the Internet works and how it can work for you (especially, but not only, if you&#8217;re on the artsy/creative side of things). There&#8217;s some <a href="http://ash10.com/surgeries/">more info about these surgeries here</a>.</p>
<p>To book a session with him, <a href="http://ash10.com/2010/07/ash-10-surgeries-july-13-15/">click this link</a> and follow the instructions. Dates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>13 July &#8211; MAC cafe</li>
<li>14 July &#8211; Fazeley Studios</li>
<li>15 July &#8211; Urban Coffee Co</li>
</ul>
<p>He&#8217;s also doing one of the &#8216;These are a few of my favourite things&#8217; talks <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/432/these_are_a_few_of_my_favourit/">at the Ikon on 11 August</a>.</p>
