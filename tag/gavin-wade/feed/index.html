The next stops on the Home of Metal tour are Wolves Art Gallery (25 Oct), New Art Gallery Walsall (6 Nov with performance by Einstellung) and Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery (7 Feb)</li>
<li><a href="http://ihaveclones.com/2008/10/birmingham/">I Have Clones</a><br />
A musician who&#8217;s just moved back to Birmingham (to finish off a degree at Aston Uni).  He gets the whole blogging thing by the looks of things</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/culture/artist-curator-gavin-wade-np-exclusive-video-interview-0">Artist Curator Gavin Wade &#8211; NP Exclusive Video Interview</a><br />
&#8220;An exclusive video interview with artist curator Gavin Wade at the opening of the new gallery Eastside Projects in the heart of Digbeth the new cultural quarter of Birmingham UK&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kebablog.co.uk/?p=438">Kebablog &#8211; Balena Project_Birmingham. â€˜08 &#8211; Ikon Gallery</a><br />
Mr Kebablog went to see (and take pictures of) the Balena Project which features a 25ft cashmere whale in the Mailbox. It&#8217;s there until 26 Oct and if you&#8217;re reading this and can&#8217;t be bothered going to see it then perhaps I should point something out &#8211; IT&#8217;S A 25FT CASHMERE WHALE!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.taktak.net/Playground/Flimflam/Entry/271/TheFineArtofSayingHello.aspx">The Fine Art of Saying â€œHelloâ€ &#8211; TAK! Design &amp; Art Direction</a><br />
Pete linked to this over a year ago but I&#8217;ve just seen it again and think it deserves another outing.  It&#8217;s a presentation that Tak did to some illustrators on the art of self-promotion.  If anyone looks at this and thinks &#8216;I can&#8217;t do that&#8217; then shout in the comments and set your face to &#8216;surprised&#8217; as help/further reading/etc come rolling in.Â  Seriously, give it a go</li>
