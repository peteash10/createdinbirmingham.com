<p>Ian and Pip from 7 Inch Cinema/Flatpack Festival have been nominated for <a href="http://www.thehospitalclub.com/100/index.php">The Hospital Club 100</a> which is:</p>
<blockquote><p>a search for the most influential people in the creative and media  industries, with the emphasis on current contribution and importance,  not just the size of someone’s celebrity status, profile, bank balance,  titles or past reputation</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve no idea what the award would mean but they say it&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/2010/06/incoming/">make their mums  proud</a>, which is good enough reason for me. Besides, Ian and Pip are good souls who do some good work. Speaking of which, they have <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/2010/06/incoming/">some events coming up</a>.</p>
<p>Trawling down the other nominees, I spotted <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/slade/sac/info">Sue Collins</a> in the &#8216;Art&#8217; category. The blurb says this about her:</p>
<blockquote><p>She has recently just completed a her first solo museum show at IKON in  Birmingham, and in response was dubbed by the Mirror as the &#8216;worst  artist in Britain&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Which was enough to secure my vote.</p>

I need to keep a closer eye on what happens over there (and maybe, y&#8217;know, get round to visiting at some point).</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/2010/04/graham-vick-at-the-barber/">Ian from 7 Inch Cinema went along</a> and has blogged his notes. Lots of good things there, including:</p>
<blockquote><p>The arts in the UK are blighted with fearfulness, conservatism,  reactionary ordinariness. Our job is to build a more exciting, bolder  future than the past has been. There is no such thing as tradition. The  earth never stops moving. Stasis is a delusion. Be open to  changeability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, BOC are a currently <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/news_item.php?nid=115">rehearsing a new mini-production</a> of Stephen Oliver&#8217;s &#8216;A Man of Feeling&#8217;.</p>

<p>Ian also sent over a biog of Derek Fairbrother (1931-99), whose images they are. The following is an extended copy and paste job:</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 70s research chemist and  amateur photographer, Derek Fairbrother, made over 20 photographic time-lapse sequences showing the demolition of old buildings and their replacement by new buildings and new road systems in Birmingham city centre.</p>
<p>The completed sequences, often running to some fifty images taken over a period of five or more years, were then connected together in a narrative sequence in the form of a strip of postcard sized prints.  Fairbrother intended to use a cine camera to photograph each sequence, thereby compressing years of work into a series of short films.  However this ambition was not realised in his lifetime.</p>
<p>After his death in 1999, his widow Gaynor gifted his prints and negatives to the photography collections at Birmingham Library.</p>
<p>These short films, which will be shown for the first time in the exhibition Birmingham Seen (Gas Hall, 31st October 2009 &#8211; 3rd January 2010) have finally enabled Fairbrother’s work to be seen in the way he intended.</p>

<p>There&#8217;ll be cartoons from around the world, a pair of comedy classics with live piano accompaniment and the premiere of <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/project/travelling-picture-show/the-magic-box">The Magic Box</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still getting up to speed on what&#8217;s happening around town but thought it&#8217;d make sense to go through some of the main sources of arts/culture/ents info out there. Next up: listings websites. There are loads of em and theoretically they should all have the same information on them. Here&#8217;s the ones I know of:</p>

<p><strong>NB &#8211; The following aren&#8217;t really listings, just good sources of info:</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://russl.wordpress.com/">Russ L</a>&#8216;s monthly &#8216;Lots Of Things To See And Do In The West Midlands&#8217; series which tends to feature theatre, gigs, the main festivals and boxing/mixed martial arts (NB &#8211; don&#8217;t try and submit stuff to him or you&#8217;ll find yourself excluded).  The 7 Inch Cinema newsletter is always stuffed with interesting local events too &#8211; sign up for that on the <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/">7 Inch website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Codswallop&#8217; by <a href="http://brothersmcleod.co.uk/">The Brothers McLeod</a> has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7830076.stm">nominated for a BAFTA</a> in the category of Short Animation, pitching them against Aadrman&#8217;s Christmas TV big-hitter &#8216;Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of of Loaf and Death&#8217;.</p>
<p>The short had it&#8217;s first screening at <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/event/7inch-no-33/">a 7 Inch Cinema event</a> back in September. Ian <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/2008/09/codswallop/">gave some context</a> to the film:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Codswallop</em> is based on a series of <a href="http://brothersmcleod.co.uk/posts/show/18">postcards</a> Greg McLeod sent to his son, and it’s similar in atmosphere to their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c03b5A_gfIU">Spamland</a> shorts. Some nice mucking about with splitscreen and stereo sound too, so we’ll have to make sure we don’t get our left and right mixed up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, Ian Ravenscroft <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4talent/feature.jsp?id=14286">interviewed Greg McLeod</a> for 4Talent and they discussed Codswallop.</p>
<p>If you want to see the short for yourself, go along to The Victoria on 14 March for <a href="http://www.animationforumwm.co.uk/news-display.aspx?id=119">the next Animation Forum WM event, Shorts on Walls</a> (always recommended), taking place as part of the <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org.uk/">Flatpack Festival</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the film&#8217;s trailer:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/eTM1_PtFHzA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eTM1_PtFHzA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a heck of an achievement, so all the best to the Brothers on the night (8 Feb).</p>
