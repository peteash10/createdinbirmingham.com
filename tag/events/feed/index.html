<ul>
<li>28 May &#8211; Martin Bell will speak about his new book &#8216;The Truth That Sticks&#8217;</li>
<li>12 June &#8211; Prof Robert Knecht, esteemed historian, will introduce his book &#8216;The French Renaissance Court&#8217;</li>
<li>2 July &#8211; Catherine O&#8217;Flynn award-winning local author of &#8216;What Was Lost&#8217; (due to be turned into a film, reports <a href="http://www.thestirrer.co.uk/what-was-lost-the-movie-1405081.html">The Stirrer</a>) will read from the book and sign copies.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;ve got a reading group too, and the staff in there have always been lovely and helpful.  I can&#8217;t help thinking that a little blog to promote and record these events, recommend new books and generally help tie themselves into their community might be a good idea.</p>
<p>If you know of any independent book shops doing interesting events (preferably with some sort of interweb link) then give them a mention in the comments.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice when you ask for something and then it turns up, even if it takes a while. <a href="http://peteashton.com/2004/03/searchable_small_gigs_database_feed_site_thingy_please/">Four years ago</a> I (Pete, btw) put in a request to the interwebs for a &#8220;searchable small gigs database feed site thingy&#8221; which I could throw a bunch of criteria into and be given regular updates of stuff happening in my area that might be of interest &#8211; a middle ground between my usual sources and the useless torrent of information that most what&#8217;s on sites provide. There have been a few attempts since then but <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/">Live Brum</a> is the first that&#8217;s gotten me slightly excited. </p>
<p>Partly this is the pedigree. It&#8217;s run by Josh Hart who recently left <a href="http://mademedia.co.uk/">Made Media</a> to concentrate on this project. Made, as you may know, built the fantastic <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/">Town Hall Symphony Hall website</a> and Live Brum looks to be applying the ideas there to the rest of the city&#8217;s venues. </p>
<p>The other part is that its incredibly flexible. You can filter the information in numerous ways and subscribe to those results with ease. Stuff like subscribing to <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/venues/the-hare-hounds/genres/rock">Rock and Pop at the Hare and Hounds</a> is nice enough but being able to subscribe to a search for <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/events/search?search=destroyers">a band</a> or <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/events/search?search=post+rock">any keyword</a> is quite lovely. </p>
<p>Lots of other neat things too, such as embedding the event in your blog or website in the same way as YouTube videos, the magic being if the details change on Live Brum those changes will be reflected on your site too. Think of them as dynamic flyers. Here&#8217;s one: </p>
<p><iframe src="http://livebrum.co.uk/birmingham-hippodrome/the-courtesans-tales.mysite" width="250" height="438}"></iframe></p>
<p>And, with my tech-head on, the way Josh has <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/credits">built</a> the site lets him add all sorts of new and innovative features and integration with other social networking sites with ease. This is still early days for the site. </p>
<p>The trick, of course, is making sure the site has all the correct information. From chatting to Josh the other week he&#8217;s pretty sure he&#8217;s got this sorted out in a sustainable way, partly by ensuring promoters and venues can take their information back out in a variety of ways making it worth their while putting it in. I think there might be a bit of a steep learning curve for some of them here but, frankly, it&#8217;s about time the live music industry caught up with the 21st century. And, of course, if this site works then it will put Birmingham miles ahead of most other cities. </p>
<p>So, in short, cautious big grins all round. Nice one. </p>

<blockquote><p>Saturday Sesh is not networking, it&#8217;s not a series of seminars, it&#8217;s just a place for artists to meet, to share ideas and resources and to make things happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of which is highly laudable, so more power to their collective elbow.  Anyone interested should feel free to drop in from 3pm on Saturday 3 May and every Saturday after for drinks, nibbles and a chat.  Admission is free.</p>
<p>The Edge can be found at 79-81 Cheapside, Digbeth, Birmingham B12 0QH, or roughly where the green arrow is on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=B12+0QH&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">this map</a>.</p>
