<p>After what has felt like a quiet few months (and extended January blues) it seems that the fun of a festival season is once again upon us what with <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2013/03/13/art-soak-free-arts-festival/">Art SOAK,</a> <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2013/03/11/theatre-fever/">Theatre Fever,</a> <a href="http://www.flatpackfestival.org/">Flatpack</a> and the University of Birmingham&#8217;s <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/culture/index.aspx">Arts and Science festival</a> taking place in Birmingham over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Running Monday 18th &#8211; Sunday 24th March, and led by the University&#8217;s Cultural Engagement team, University of Birmingham&#8217;s Arts and Science festival celebrates the wealth of ideas, research and celebration across campus. The programme is rich and diverse and with over 70 events, there&#8217;s something for everyone &#8211; from Ancient Egyptian communication to Intelligent Robotics; Big Band performance to Classical Recitals; Urban vegetable growing to Dirty New Media. Alongside University initiated events, we have also collaborated with regional partners including Flatpack Festival, Vivid Projects, Birmingham Opera Company, Kino 10, and Writing West Midlands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/britishsciencefestival/">British Science Festival</a> has been taking place in Birmingham this week. Based around Aston University, the festival has brought a whole host of seminars, workshops and activities to make our brains ache, along with a chance to show that scientists can play just as hard as they work. Starting with this flash mob of dancing lab coats&#8230;</p>

<p>Already there has been plenty of interesting topics at the festival, including <a href="http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/FestivalNews/_Obesity.htm">why exercise won&#8217;t cure obesity</a>, <a href="http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/FestivalNews/_ExploringtheDarkSide.htm">how lasers are being used to explore the dark side of space</a>, <a href="http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/FestivalNews/_replacingfriends.htm">why finding love means loosing two of your best friends</a>, and <a href="http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/FestivalNews/_earthquakes.htm">the preparation for an imminent British earthquake</a>. The <a href="http://newoptimists.com/2010/09/16/thank-you-and-theres-more/">New Optimists</a> also had a few events to coincide with the festival, including their book launch, and a panel event at Aston University.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;ve been stuck at work all week, you can still catch plenty of things to do at the weekend, take a look at the <a href="http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/britishsciencefestival/WhatsOn/Onlineprogrammesearch.htm">online programme</a> in full, where you can also filter out which events are suitable for your level of science knowledge and interests.</p>
