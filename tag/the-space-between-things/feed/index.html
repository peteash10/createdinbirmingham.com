<p>After being independently published, Birmingham writer <a href="http://charliemachill.weebly.com/index.html">Charlie Hill&#8217;s</a> first novel &#8216;The Space Between Things&#8217; is set in Moseley and looks at the free party people and road  protesters of the early 1990&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Fellow Birmingham author,  Jim Crace, described his writing as &#8216;intelligent and witty&#8217;. Jonathan Coe also gave praise for the book;</p>
<blockquote><p>What I liked very much about the novel  was that it vividly captures a moment in Britain&#8217;s recent past, and  takes us inside a world and a milieu which most readers won&#8217;t have known  before. And of course, as a tragic love story, it packs aÂ considerable  punch.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book will be out 1 October, along with a launch event on 14 October at Waterstones&#8217; Birmingham High  Street branch.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Space Between Things&#8217; can be pre-ordered from Amazon, Waterstones and London Review Bookshop, but you&#8217;d like a head start, Charlie has posted the <a href="http://charliemachill.weebly.com/read-the-first-chapter.html">first chapter online</a>.</p>
