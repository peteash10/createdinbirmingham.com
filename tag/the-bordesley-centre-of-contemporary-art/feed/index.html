<p>The Museum of Windows exhibition opens at <a href=" www.bordesleycentreofcontemporaryart.com">Bordesley Centre of Contemporary Art</a>, Digbeth, on Fri 10 September, with an Artists Talk at 18.30 – 20.30.</p>
<p>Taking the form of an instalation, the exhibition takes vacant or dilapidated factories and warehouses in Digbeth, and proposes their hypothetical redevelopment as art galleries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The proposed designs combine aspects of white cube galleries with the existing structures of local buildings, whilst also replacing one or more of the outer walls with glass facades. Were they to be built, these structures would transform previously abandoned spaces into sites of artistic appreciation and their transparent facades would allow visitors to view the surrounding industrial landscapes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exhibition will run across the weekend of 11 &amp; 12 September, open each day from 10am &#8211; 5pm.</p>
