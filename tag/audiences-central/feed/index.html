				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://www.thepublic.com/">The Public</a> for the showcase event of the <a href="http://www.dcdprogramme.org.uk/">DCD Programme</a>. In case you&#8217;d not heard of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Arts Council England West Midlands&#8217; Digital Content Development (DCD) Programme is a three year programme of investment which aims to catalyse the creation and creative use of digital content platforms for arts organisations across the West Midlands region</p></blockquote>
<p>The website went up recently and the map on the homepage shows some of the projects, along with how much money they received. Further information is due on the website at some point, but if you look at the <a href="view-source:http://www.dcdprogramme.org.uk/">page source</a> then you can glean a little more. On the basis that you probably don&#8217;t want to ruin your eyes, here&#8217;s what I found:</p>

<p>As well as these projects, the programme supported a range of other activities including workshops, innovation labs and other events.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard of one or two of these projects, but the vast majority are new to me so it&#8217;ll be interesting to hear a little more. I should probably also add that I&#8217;m involved in the <a href="http://www.rosiekay.co.uk/">Rosie Kay Dance Company</a> project &#8211; that&#8217;ll launch next week so I&#8217;ll blab a bit more about it then.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know the deal by now. I witter on about cuts to arts funding and make up for it all with a picture of a bunny at the end. Only this time it&#8217;s a video.</p>
<p>Now, the good thing about writing this twelve hours after today&#8217;s announcement is that everyone else has summarised, pontificated and moved on. I can just link to what they&#8217;ve written. Blogging is ace. Anyway, onward&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/across-board-69-cut-funding-arts-organisations-201/">Arts Council&#8217;s announcement</a>. Fair play to them for getting this out in reasonably good time following the spending review.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/news/?id=897">Audiences Central have summarised things</a> and the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2010/10/26/rsc-to-lose-1m-in-funding-as-arts-council-cuts-hit-west-midlands-65233-27547754/">Birmingham Post has calculated the cuts</a> the region&#8217;s orgs are going to face from April 2011.</p>
<p>To skip through the announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/regular-funding-organisations/">regularly funded organisations</a> will have their funding cut by 6.9% in 2011/2012</li>
<li>By 2014/15 cuts will have risen to 14.9% in real terms (ie. ignoring inflation)</li>
<li><a href="http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/">Arts and Business</a> and <a href="http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/">Creativity, Culture and Education</a> will have their public funding halved next year and taken away completely the year after that. That&#8217;s very bad news for them</li>
<li>The Arts Council will have to halve its admin costs</li>
<li>There&#8217;ll be a new system for funding from 2012 onwards (arrangements to be announced 4 November 2010). Everyone will have to reapply &#8211; some existing orgs won&#8217;t be successful, some new ones will</li>
<li>The budget for budget for &#8216;strategic opportunities for artistic work&#8217; such as touring, large events and the Cultural Leadership Programme is being knocked down by 64%</li>
</ul>
<p>Next year will be a &#8216;transition year&#8217;, hence the lower-than-expected cuts, the stay of execution for A&amp;B and CCE and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/oct/26/arts-bodies-face-budget-cuts?CMP=twt_gu">the Guardian describing arts groups as &#8216;relieved&#8217;</a>. So expect things to get worse. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget the local authority funding that&#8217;s disappearing.</p>
<p>In A&amp;B&#8217;s &#8216;defence&#8217; Colin Tweedy has released <a href="http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/Home/News/2010/october/response-to-funding-decisions.aspx">an utterly unimpressive statement</a> quoting <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-10-25a.1.10&amp;s=speaker:10632#g3.0">an easily-swatted away question in Parliament</a> and referring to the generalised views of unnamed &#8216;private sector partners&#8217;. Go get em, tiger.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s not all bad news in the arts. Working at the top at the Royal Opera House <a href="http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/eadweardmuybridge/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/templates/artsdesk2009/images/plugins/system/jceutilities/themes/standard/css/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2465:royal-opera-house-chief's-%C2%A3630000-salary&amp;Itemid=105">can net you £630,000 a year</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I went along to <a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/wolves">Wolverhampton Art Gallery</a> to hear about the Arts Council&#8217;s new national campaign for the arts &#8211; due to start in April 2010. Here&#8217;s the opening presentation that was delivered by Julie Eaglen, Arts Council WM&#8217;s Audience Development Officer.</p>
<div id="__ss_2567490" style="width: 477px; text-align: left;"><a style="font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;" title="Arts Council WM Presentation, November 09" href="http://www.slideshare.net/chrisunitt/arts-council-wm-presentation-november-09">Arts Council WM Presentation, November 09</a><object style="margin:0px" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="477" height="510" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayerd.swf?doc=acewmpresentationwolvesnov09-091123133450-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=arts-council-wm-presentation-november-09" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed style="margin:0px" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="477" height="510" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayerd.swf?doc=acewmpresentationwolvesnov09-091123133450-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=arts-council-wm-presentation-november-09" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>The standout point from the presentation for me is this bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>… despite the significant efforts of arts organisations and the Arts Council to broaden audiences &#8211; and there has been, and is, some really excellent work going on &#8211; our statistics show that there has been no significant shift in the profile of people who engage with the arts over the past three years.</p>
<p>This means that we can&#8217;t simply continue doing more of the same; it&#8217;s not working. We need a new approach</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the presentation to see how this is to be achieved (and from the tone of language used, it <em>has to be </em>achieved), but in a nutshell there&#8217;ll be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a programme of arts engagement activity</li>
<li>a large-scale broadcast, media and marketing campaign</li>
<li>targeting of an identified group of 12.8 million people who currently have some interest in the arts but have expressed an inclination/desire to do or see more</li>
<li>a new national arts web portal</li>
</ul>
<p>Locally, the programme is being coordinated by <a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk">Audiences Central</a>. Each region has been asked to pick a hot-spot to focus their activity on and in the West Mids it&#8217;ll be the Black Country. It&#8217;s hoped that the rest of the region will benefit from a &#8216;halo effect&#8217; from this activity and from the national media campaign.</p>
<p>On this last point, the idea is to develop a brand and kitemark that venues, promoters, organisations, etc will want to apply to their work in the same way that many food producers have voluntarily taken up the 5-a-day brand.</p>
<p>Success will be measured via the <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/research_and_statistics/4828.aspx">national Taking Part survey</a> and the <a href="http://www.sportengland.org/research/active_people_survey.aspx">Active Peoples survey</a> (for local authorities that use an <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/research_and_statistics/6230.aspx">indicator called NI11</a> &#8211; hopefully that&#8217;ll mean something to someone).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the budget for the national campaign is but, after much talk of &#8216;limited resources&#8217;, it transpired that the amount of cash available for the West Mids (and therefore the Black Country) is £200,000 over two years. Consequently there was much talk about partnership working and the reliance on organisations finding a benefit in piggybacking on the national campaign.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Arts Council have set up a website at <a href="http://www.helloart.org.uk">Hello Art</a> where you can find out a little more and sign up for future updates. It&#8217;d be also be worth following <a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/">Audiences Central</a> for updates about the West Mids focus.</p>
<p>Finally (and because someone asked me to keep count):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentions of <a href="http://www.inthebigpicture.co.uk/">The Big Picture</a> &#8211; 7</li>
<li>Mentions of the <a href="http://www.5aday.nhs.uk/topTips/default.html">5-a-day campaign</a> &#8211; 7</li>
</ul>

&#8220;Audiences Central, with arts consultant Kerry Endsor, is looking to develop and deliver a high-profile, public-facing, arts project that will encourage and inspire young people in the West Midlands to engage with the arts and culture&#8221;.

A couple of the Audiences Central peeps have started their own blogs recently, with this one from Fiona likely to be the most, um, quirky. She has/had a secret obsession &#8211; rating the city&#8217;s (and likely other cities&#8217;) toilets. So far pubs and restaurants feature highly</li>
