<p style="text-align: left;">Today (14th February) sees the start of <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/" target="_blank">New Art West Midlands</a> 2014. It was announced in December that 24 emerging artists from our own regional universities would exhibit their work within four different galleries across Birmingham and Wolverhampton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.tpwestmidlands.org.uk/">A Turning Point West Midlands</a> initiative, New Art West Midlands exhibits the work of 24 artists, all of whom have graduated from one of the region’s undergraduate and postgraduate fine art degree courses in the past three years: Birmingham City University, Coventry University, Staffordshire University, University of Wolverhampton and University of Worcester.  Encompassing four nationally important galleries plus five universities, it is the largest partnership of its kind in England.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Who are the Artists?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of the artists have recently come from undergraduate and postgraduate courses. There really is a great range of different artists <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/nawm-2014" target="_blank">here</a>, with their work ranging from sculpture, film, photography, performance to painting.</p>

The Barber Institute of Fine Arts owes its existence to the vision of Dame Martha Constance Hattie Barber (1869–1933). First opened by Queen Mary in 1939, the art deco building owes its design to architect Robert Atkinson (1833-1952) and has since been a home to major art collections, a public gallery and the original concert hall for the University of Birmingham. Their collection includes paintings by Old Masters including Botticelli, Rubens, Gainsborough and Turner, as well as Impressionist and other 19th and 20th-century masterpieces by Monet, Degas, Renoir and Magritte.</p>
