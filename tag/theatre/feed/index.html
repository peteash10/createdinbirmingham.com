It&#8217;s a large scale theatrical experiment taking place this Thursday and Saturday (<em>Saturday event sold out</em>), with a cast comprising of companies who have performed @ A E Harris over the last five years. There will be no rehearsals, and the cast will work from instructions and timetables given to them, with no idea what anyone else in the room will be doing &#8211; sure to result in surprises for the cast and audience alike.</p>
<blockquote><p>As the show is both a celebration and unusually long, the bar will be open throughout serving flaming cocktails alongside snacks and more familiar drinks. Both cabaret and raked seating will be available for you to either engross yourself in the show or discuss it as it unfolds with your friends. You can change your viewing angle whenever you wish to concentrate on whatever strand of action you find most absorbing. Whatever happens it will be an event to which you will always want to say &#8220;and I was there&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/project-twilightofthefreakingods.html">Twilightofthefreakingods</a> will be the last performance at the venue before it &#8216;downsizes&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;The 48 Hour Musical project is this crazy thing where a bunch of writers, composers, performers, directors, designers and musicians all get together and give themselves just 48 solid hours to write, produce and perform a brand new musical. There’s no pre-planning of the show at all, other than to make sure there’s the pressure of an audience waiting at the end of it. So, within reason, pretty much anything could happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are looking for funding to make their idea happen. They&#8217;ve set up a kickstarter style <a href="http://the48hourmusical.com/">sponsor page</a> where you can read more about the project, and donate as little as £1 if you think that it&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to support. As with all kickstarters, there are rewards in return for your donations. At the time of publishing this post, they are at just over 50% of their target. The money they receive will pay for the set, props, theatre hire, tech hire, costumes&#8230; and so forth. The event itself will be ticketed separately later in the year, and performed at the <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">Mac</a>.</p>

<p>This looks to be an extremely exciting opportunity for theatre producers in the city centre as Sheffield&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pointblank.org.uk/">Point Blank Theatre</a> takes up residency in the now empty (used as the Christmas pop-up shop last year) unit on New Street. <a href="http://makeshiftbirmingham.wordpress.com/">Here is a description for the unit that will be called Make.Shift</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point Blank Theatre has secured the short-term lease on an empty shop unit in a prime location on New Street, right in the heart of Birmingham’s bustling city centre. During this time the space will be used by local theatre-makers to collaborate, network, and rehearse.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The shop unit will also play host to the <a title="Three-Week Window Festival" href="http://makeshiftbirmingham.wordpress.com/three-week-window/">Three-Week Window Festival</a>, a brand new festival for Birmingham curated by local theatre companies <a title="Little Earthquake's Website" href="http://www.little-earthquake.com/" target="_blank">Little Earthquake</a> and <a title="Tin Box's Website" href="http://www.tinboxtheatre.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tin Box</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://makeshiftbirmingham.wordpress.com/three-week-window/">Three Week Window Festival</a> has been open for submissions but is in the last few days of application. Here is a description of what looks to be a great event:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Local theatre companies <a href="http://www.little-earthquake.com/">Little Earthquake</a> and <a href="http://www.tinboxtheatre.co.uk/">Tin Box</a> are curating a new festival in the unit between Monday 3<sup>rd</sup> and Sunday 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2012 called <em>Three-Week Window.</em> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The shop unit has a large street-level window measuring 5 and a half metres wide by 2 and a half metres tall, and thousands of people walk past it every day. We’re looking for up to 18 artists, companies or organisations who would each like to take over the shop window for a single day. Whatever you decide to do in the window is up to you…</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Perhaps you’re a theatre-maker with an idea for a performance; an installation artist who could transform the window into something unique; or a visual artist who would like to display their work. Whoever you are, whatever you do, we’re keen to hear about ideas that will turn heads and stop people in their tracks for three special weeks in September.</strong></p>
<p>The full criteria for performers is <a href="http://makeshiftbirmingham.wordpress.com/three-week-window/">available here</a>, but it seems as if the huge shop windows will become a theatre stage where passers by can stop and watch performers behind the glass.</p>
<p>I think this pop-up culture is outstanding and will hopefully inspire and open up even more opportunities for Birmingham to use its empty spaces more creatively &#8211; especially for local companies such as Tin Box.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Some of Birmingham&#8217;s most creative musicians and performers have come together for the &#8216;<a href="http://www.stockhausenbirmingham.co.uk/">Stockhausen Festival of Light</a>&#8216;, a celebration of the hugely influential electronic composer Karlheinz Stockhausen running from 19-21 August. With the backing of the Birmingham musical institutions of the University of Birmingham and the Birmingham Conservatoire, speakers from all around the world have been brought in to share their thoughts on the man. These talks will all lead up to big finale of the festival in the spectacle of the <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/">Birmingham Opera Company</a>&#8216;s performance of Stockenhausen&#8217;s opera &#8220;<a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=91&amp;Itemid=120">Mittwoch aus Licht</a>&#8221; that will be performed at Argyle Works.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This will be the world premiere of the opera, which has been previously labelled &#8220;unstageable&#8221;; and no wonder with this description: &#8220;string quartet performing in helicopters, electronic and acoustic music and a dancing camel&#8221;.  Unfortunately tickets for the performances are all sold out, BUT there is still hope!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you want to catch one of Birmingham&#8217;s best theatrical production companies doing something never seen fully on stage ever before, your only chance to see some of the 6 hour Opera will be a visit to the dress rehearsal on Tuesday 21 August as part of the Stockhausen festival, or head to the website the Space (<a href="http://thespace.org/" target="_blank">http://thespace.org/</a>) where <wbr>the Helicopter String Quartet is due to be broadcast.</wbr></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This just in:  The Big Screen in Victoria Square on Wed 22nd will be showing a live  satellite relay, so now you have no excuse to miss out.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As part of the festival will a performance at the MAC called &#8216;<a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/event/modified-stockhausen-feat-modified-toy-orchestra">Modified Stockhausen</a>&#8216; and will feature the Birmingham toy tamperers <a href="http://www.modifiedtoyorchestra.com/live.php">Modified Toy Orchestra</a>, tracing their influence back to Stockhausen through their playful electronic dismantlements.</p>
