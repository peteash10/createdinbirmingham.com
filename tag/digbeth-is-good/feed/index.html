<p>Just a quick round up of everything going on this weekend, there&#8217;s a lot and we wouldn&#8217;t want you to forget and miss out on anything!</p>
<p><strong>Cum Clubbing</strong> &#8211; Hosted by <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">VIVID</a>,  this art party does not look like something to be missed (although it&#8217;s happening now, so get down quick). From 8pm &#8211;  late, VIVID&#8217;s project space will be taken over by live music, DJs and  visual artists who&#8217;ll conspire to create an excitingly strange evening  of camp disco. Tickets are £5.</p>
<p>To  save time I&#8217;m going to be both lazy and efficient, and link you to  everyone else who&#8217;s been talking about this. Take a look at <a href="http://digbeth.org/2010/09/cum-clubbing-at-vivid-this-saturday-10th-september/">Digbeth is Good</a>, <a href="http://morecanalsthanvenice.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/cum-clubbing/">More Canals than Venice</a>, <a href="http://brianduffyhasabigbrain.com/post/1003304250/cum-clubbing-for-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an">brianduffyhasabigbrain</a>, and <a href="http://www.birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk/2010/08/cum-clubbing%E2%80%9Cfor-one-night-only-vivid-hosts-an-art.html">Birmingham: It&#8217;s Not Shit</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just read an email pointing out that Creative Playground has changed tack slightly and is now <a href="http://www.meetup.com/digitalplayground/">Digital Playground</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital Playground was created in an  attempt to network the digital creative industries within Birmingham</p></blockquote>
<p>The next meet-up is on Friday 25 June at the Spotted Dog in Digbeth. Joining <a href="http://www.meetup.com/digitalplayground/">the Meetup group</a> and RSVP-ing would be handy.</p>
<p>There should be a fair few people down there. As well as this, the Spotted Dog will be hosting <a href="http://digbeth.org/2010/06/dogbeth-is-goods-second-birthday-this-friday-25th-june/">Digbeth is Good&#8217;s 2nd birthday</a> and the folks at <a href="http://www.aquila-tv.com/">Aquila TV</a> are relocating their regular All Bar One drinks for the evening.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be popular for another reason. A meet-up for Digital Playground? Um, did anyone try googling that?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A while back I mentioned a strange meet up named <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/02/25/creative-networks-barg-meet-ups/" target="_blank">BARG</a> happening in the back of an old pub in Digbeth  These meetings were for anyone with a creative mind or just a childlike desire to play, and looked at how we can use mobile technology and social media stuff to play interesting games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3593" title="barg1" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg" alt="barg1" width="597" height="113" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1.jpg 597w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/barg1-300x56.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These games, much like the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emergentgame.org.uk%2F&amp;ei=lQoCSuiBLJO7jAfS6vWCBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCpUVPvs2vikW9RIOFM29RHKwKWg&amp;sig2=CHgA-fRtUiic7FJq5Q4C9A" target="_blank">Emergent Game</a> a few years ago prove that interactive play doesn&#8217;t have to be homed exclusively online or in the playground but can explore geographical areas in new ways, look at how we now communicate online and off, and give a chance for grown adults to play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Nicky doing good work in the city is Nicky Getgood who writes the blog <a href="http://digbeth.org/" target="_blank">Digbeth is Good</a>. She uses social media stuff like maps, videos and games within her blog which demand importance in the real world and sets the context firmly within the geographical area and a real community. The most interesting projects I have seen recently rely on this process of interweaving online and offline participation, such as <a href="http://4amproject.org/" target="_blank">4am Project</a> and other activities like Flickr meetups which happen in the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now spring has sprung the BARG group are taking games onto the streets of Birmingham, with the aim of  taking a fresh look at neglected parts of the city, and reclaiming them much like how skateboarders do. This Saturday between 2pm and about 7pm they will be hosting an afternoon of play and picnics on Curzon Street. For more information and maps etc go to <a href="http://www.npugh.co.uk/blog/w_i_d_e_o_p_e_n_s_p_a_c_e/" target="_blank">Nikki&#8217;s personal blog.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a bit of a debate about Created in Birmingham going on over at <a href="http://daveharte.com/birmingham/created-in-birmingham-time-to-move-on/" target="_blank">Dave Harte&#8217;s blog</a>. It has been suggested that CiB has lost a bit of &#8216;umpf&#8217; of late, that it may have strayed from it&#8217;s original purpose, or is lacking that special something that made it what it was. I am keen to get some of the regular readers in on the debate. I would be really interested to hear your feedback, warts and all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3207 aligncenter" title="google-map" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google-map.jpg" alt="google-map" width="398" height="211" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google-map.jpg 499w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/google-map-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>
<p>In light of this, I wanted to let you know some things I am working on at the moment. I&#8217;m going to be changing the aesthetic of the blog, and changing the template we use. I&#8217;ll be using a free, downloadable template  just as Pete did when he first created CiB. I will be doing this for several reasons, one simply because I am not a technical person and wouldn&#8217;t have a clue how to design or adapt my own, but mostly because I want to encourage others to start blogs by using these free tools that are available to anyone.</p>
<p>I am also working on a great big CiB Google Map of Birmingham. As a reader of CiB one question has always stuck with me: &#8220;That gallery / project / meetup / exhibition looks great, but where the hell is it?&#8221; When putting this map together and encouraging others to contribute, I am hoping to find lots of exciting stuff happening all over the city; it&#8217;s suburbs and back streets, North &amp; South. I have been partly inspired by Nicky Getgood&#8217;s: <a href="http://digbeth.org/maps-and-photos/arty-trail/" target="_blank">Digbeth is Good Arty Trail</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the map should be a comprehensive documentation of creativity in Birmingham, but a rich working document which evolves over time with many contributors adding locations, photographs, video and trails.</p>

BiNS provides an update on the previously mentioned &#8216;The Eye of the Storm&#8217; project. &#8220;One hundred and fifty people from around Brum  (including Clare Short) were interviewed  to discover eachâ€™s individual attempts to â€œmanage the stresses of modern living and find calm within the stormâ€.&#8221; The outdoor installation part will be in Birmingham next year</li>
