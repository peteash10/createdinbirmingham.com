				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not Charlie Windsor, although he was meant to be in Birmingham today <a href="http://birminghamcentral.blogspot.com/2010/12/royal-likeness.html">to unveil a statue</a> (snow stopped play).</p>
<p>This is the Prince of Wales pub in Moseley, which I&#8217;ve just discovered <a href="http://princeofwales.wordpress.com/">has a blog</a>. The owners use it to talk about upcoming events but also to rail against what they see as the negative effect or regeneration/gentrification in the area.</p>
<p>The latest cause for concern apparently came up at an acoustic folk night on Tuesday evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>a few weeks ago Crosby Lend Lease, the developer of the proposed flats next door, came to the Tuesday night folk session. One of their employees pretended to want to record some of the folk session for radio, so the musicans and my staff agreed. This person then used noise level recording equipment to record the sound levels in the pub. This information can now be used against us.</p></blockquote>
