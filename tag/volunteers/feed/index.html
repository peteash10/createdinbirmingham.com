You can drop in anytime between 5.30pm to 7.00pm. Volunteers will be on hand to offer free advice to anyone who is curious to how tools like blogs, podcasts, video and social networks could help to their organisation, community group or charity. The surgery will be: No boring speeches or jargon just hot drink and some friendly advice.</p>

<p>I have a particular interest in how small organisations can use all this &#8216;internet stuff&#8221; to promote themselves so I will be going along for the first time to offer up my bit of  knowledge and heaps of enthusiasm to anyone who needs it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Capsule need a couple of people to help out at their festival:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are 2 festival internships available to assist with: Artists liaison / Production / Marketing / Festival Management you will be required to do 5 -10 days between May to July. You will receive valuable work experience and be credited as part of the core team that deliver Supersonic Festival.</p>
<p>In addition to this we need a team of volunteers to help deliver the festival over the weekend of the event itself 10th-14th July and in the run up to Supersonic from June onwards. You will be required to do a minimum of 6 hrs over the weekend in return for a day ticket and festival t-shirt.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus it&#8217;s a good item to get on the CV &#8211; this has been called one of the UK&#8217;s best-run festivals, after all.  If you&#8217;re over 18 and are interested in getting involved then email info[at]capsule.org.uk and put &#8216;volunteer&#8217; as the subject.</p>
