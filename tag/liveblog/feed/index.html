				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Alex and I are at the <a href="http://cityasaplatform.posterous.com/">City As A Platform</a> event, organised by Screen WM and taking place at Aston University Business School and Conference Centre.</p>
<blockquote><p>Building on the City as a Platform event that took place during the Conservative Party Conference 2010, this full day of panels and breakout sessions will explore these issues and opportunities, presenting case studies including Maverick Digital’s groundbreaking NHS Local project and the Screen WM/Channel 4 supported ChromaRoma, which uses the London Underground Oyster Card system as a playing piece in a city-wide social game.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 6.30pm today I&#8217;m running a liveblog for <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk">International Dance Festival Birmingham</a> at a debate that will look at <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/news/2010/04/20/the-election-debate-live/">the future of public investment in the arts</a>. The Hippodrome are hosting and these are the panelists:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/edward_vaizey/wantage">Ed Vaizey</a> (Conservative)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/sion_simon/birmingham%2C_erdington">Siôn Simon</a> (Labour)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/lord_clement-jones">Lord Clement-Jones</a> (Lib Dem)</li>
<li>Marc Reeves (<a href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/">TheBusinessDesk.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Journalist, broadcaster and author, <a href="http://www.rosiemillard.com/">Rosie Millard</a> will chair the debate.</p>
<p>The politicians on the panel are, or have until recently been, party spokespeople for arts  and culture. Marc Reeves has recently <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/6569.aspx">advised DCMS</a> on new models of independent news provision. They&#8217;re all busy people at the moment so pinning them down can&#8217;t have been easy.</p>
<p>What would you want to see them asked? How far spending cuts are going to go? Whether encouraging philanthropy is going to help anyone other than large venues? What the heck they were thinking with the Digital Economy Act? </p>
<p>You can watch follow the debate on CiB below and chip in with any thoughts or comments as we go along. The liveblog has <a href="http://www.scribblelive.com/Event/Dancing_on_Thin_Ice">a page of its own here</a> too.</p>
