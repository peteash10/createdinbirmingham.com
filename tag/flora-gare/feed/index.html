<p><a href="http://www.swimmingwithoutwater.org/">Swimming Without Water</a> is a contemporary art exhibition in Moseley Road Baths, which I think it&#8217;s fair to say, is not your usual art venue. New works have been commissioned for the non-gallery space and they will be on show between 18th February and 15th March. Here&#8217;s some more info:</p>
<blockquote><p>The artists, <a href="http://www.debbygary.co.uk/">Debbie Akam</a>, <a href="http://www.axisweb.org/seCVWK.aspx?ARTISTID=8915">Flora Gare</a>, and <a href="http://www.timskinner.co.uk/">Tim Skinner</a>, are working to bind their works with this glorious, historic building, to re-enliven it, to repopulate it through an engagement with the building and the audience (both swimmers and non-swimmers from Moseley Road and beyond) through the medium of art.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://swimmingwithoutwater.org/">Swimming Without Water</a> is a group exhibition taking place in January 2010 at Moseley Road Bath Centre.</p>
<p>Contemporary artists Flora Gare, Debbie Akam and Tim Skinner will create a site-specific exhibition with the aim of encouraging the local and wider community to rediscover Moseley Road Baths and experience them in a different way. It will also potentially help towards the conservation of a building of historic importance.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.moseleyroadbaths.co.uk/">The Friends of Moseley Road Baths</a> are currently campaigning to secure the building&#8217;s future. You can find out more about that on their website.</p>
