				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iain Grant, writer and editor of <a title="PPP" href="http://pigeonparkpress.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Pigeon Park Press</a>, is calling for expression of interest from writers for their new project Ten to One and you have until March 31st to get in touch with a sample of your work and a brief writing bio.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14683" alt="Ten To One" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53-248x300.png" width="248" height="300" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53-248x300.png 248w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-03-18-at-16.54.53.png 648w" sizes="(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px" /></p>
<p>So, what is Ten to One?</p>
<blockquote><p>Ten To One is a collaborative writing project. Ten writers will work together to produce a novel-length piece of fiction which will then by published by Pigeon Park Press. Each writer will handle one of ten central characters and write the chapters focussing on that character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The most exciting, and unique, feature of this project is that after each writer has written one chapter one of the characters will be kicked out of the story. The character that is kicked out is decided by both a panel of judges, this will be three individuals who are known and respected in the writing world and will change as the project moves on, and a public vote. At the end of the novel there will be one character left from the initial ten; Ten To One.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans for what genre Ten To One will be, making it a blank page for the differing styles and ideas of each writer to develop together into one story.</p>
<p>Contact details and further information about this project can be found <a title="PPP" href="http://pigeonparkpress.blogspot.co.uk/p/ten-to-one-collaboratively-written.html" target="_blank">here</a>. IainÂ is keen for anyone with questions to contact him to discuss the project further. There is also a <a title="TenToOneFacebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/TenToOneNovel" target="_blank">Ten To One</a> Facebook page and <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/TenToOneNovel" target="_blank">Twitter</a> page.</p>
<p>So writers, what are you waiting for?</p>
