				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of all the things on last night I only made it to two out of five. I missed out on the opening of <a href="http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/programme/current/event/339/ryoji_ikeda/">Ryoji Ikeda&#8217;s exhibition at Ikon Eastside</a> (which I might go and catch at lunchtime today), Jordan McKenzie&#8217;s &#8216;Day Into Night&#8217; at <a href="http://www.vivid.org.uk/">Vivid</a> and <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/10/09/foxcolourruth-green/">Colour&#8217;s night at The Victoria</a> featuring World of Fox&#8217;s album launch.</p>
<p>Still, I did make it along to the <a href="http://www.artsandbusiness.org.uk/News/2009/Jul_Sep/mid_jag_lr_awards.aspx">Arts &amp; Business Awards</a>. The special guest was Patrick Stewart (who walked, not teleported on stage &#8211; disappointing) and the winners were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Award &#8211; EC-Arts &amp; National Express Coach</li>
<li>Cultural Branding Award &#8211; Stan&#8217;s Cafe &amp; AE Harris (Birmingham) Ltd</li>
<li>Museum, Libraries and Archives Award &#8211; Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust &amp; Inchscape Motors Shrewsbury</li>
<li>People Development Award &#8211; Holte Visual &amp; Performing Arts College, St Francis Primary School &amp; Signet Trading Ltd</li>
<li>Sustained Partnership Award &#8211; Sinfonia ViVA &amp; Rolls Royce plc</li>
<li>Young People Award &#8211; County Youth Arts &amp; Balfour Beatty Capital</li>
<li>Business Volunteer of the Year Award &#8211; Colin Wells from Prologic plc &amp; Multistory (also winner of the Champion of Champions Award)</li>
</ul>
<p>Congrats to all of them.</p>
<p>After that I wandered down to the Sunflower Lounge for <a href="http://galleryofowls.org/news/all-you-can-eat-zine/">Gallery of Owl&#8217;s &#8216;All You Can Eat Zine&#8217;</a> which was fantastic &#8211; billed as &#8216;a night of Zines, comics, small press, music and performance&#8217;. It provided all of that as well as a palpable sense of</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stay for that long, but long enough to catch <a href="http://www.richardpeel.com/">Richard Peel</a>&#8216;s entertaining performance of Dracula, have a chat with Claire from <a href="http://www.attagrrl.co.uk/">ATTA grrl</a> a buy a couple of zines (ATTA grrl and Girls Who Draw, since you asked). There was a good turnout, a great atmosphere and the excitement of knowing there&#8217;s loads of interesting stuff going on around the city.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I picked up:</p>

<p>And check out the hand stamp too &#8211; easily the best one I&#8217;ve had in a while:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of this might not be hugely relevant/interesting to most but hopefully it&#8217;ll be useful to someone out there.Â  Interestingness will be resumed shortly.</p>
<p>Arts &amp; Business Awards</p>
<p>&#8220;Nominations are now open for the <a href="http://195.167.181.219/Login.aspx">30th Arts &amp; Business Awards</a>, designed to celebrate excellence in the field of arts and business partnerships and sponsorships&#8221;<br />
Deadline for nominations is 30 May.  Further information might be on <a href="http://195.167.181.219/Login.aspx">their website</a> but, frankly, if they want to deliberately hide it away I&#8217;m not going to look for it.</p>
<p>Open 08 West Midands</p>
<p>&#8220;Open is a biennial collaboration between Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery and Wolverhampton Art Gallery, celebrating the vibrant talent of the art scene in the West Midlands and allowing regional artists the chance to show their work at these prestigious venues.&#8221;<br />
The deadline is 28 May 2008.  Follow the link for <a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/wolves/whats_on/003618.html">application packs and further details</a>.</p>
<p>Short Cuts Film submissions for ArtsFest</p>
<p><a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=3983">D&#8217;log</a> reports that the Short Cuts Film programmers are seeking submissions but warns that the deadline for seeing and agreeing films is tight.  I&#8217;ve not found any further useful information on this but D&#8217;log has the contact details so I&#8217;d start there if you&#8217;re interested.  (Via <a href="http://www.d-log.info/?p=3983 ">D&#8217;log</a>).</p>
<p>BSCI grant funding suspended</p>
<p>The budgets for Birmingham City Council&#8217;s feasibility and creative space grants is now fully committed.  If this affects you, or you&#8217;d not heard of these grants and are interested then bookmark <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/bsci.bcc">this page</a> and check back in June.  Appreciative nod to <a href="http://www.star-one.org.uk/">Simon Gray</a>.</p>
<p>Changes to Grants for the Arts</p>
<p>From 20 May 2008 several changes to the programme run by Arts Council England will come into effect.  Further info on the <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/gfta2006.php">Arts Council England website</a>.
