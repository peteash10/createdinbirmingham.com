<p>This was officially announced back on 9 October but I only noticed today when a copy of <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=52015&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=5111">Forward</a> flopped onto my doormat with the information on the back page.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 13 year old <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=142377&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=5249">Megan Bradbury is the new Birmingham Young Poet Laureate</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Chris Morgan&#8217;s poem The Car Body Plant:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="black">I always        cycled in through pre-dawn<br />
gloom, it seemed, for the 7.15 start,<br />
yellow        and sweating beneath my cape,<br />
just one of a tide of half-asleeps<br />
flowing        into that infernal manufactory,<br />
smoke-city of the blood-red night,        each<br />
of us squeezed into a terrifying conformity;<br />
for them, fat        pay-packets like an addiction.</p>
<p>My green boiler-suit, APPRENTICE<br />
on        chest pocket, possessed me,<br />
marking me out, to be sent<br />
for        left-handed screwdrivers, for tubs<br />
of elbow grease, for a laff. My O        levels<br />
and RP accent made me an outsider,<br />
fuelled a mutual        misunderstanding,<br />
and a soupcon (my word, not theirs) of guilt.</p>
<p>Huge        presses shook the floor, crunching<br />
improbable shapes from steel        sheets,<br />
Richter six point something as I walked past;<br />
older press        operators all lacked<br />
a finger, blood sacrifice to inattention;<br />
hearing        dimmed by decades of carcrash;<br />
I never asked about their hearts or        souls.<br />
On assembly lines, spotwelding guns</p>
<p>were like        futuristic weapons from a movie,<br />
spitting chains of sparks across        gangways<br />
as their superhero crab-claws pinched,<br />
and the air        smelled sharply of lung-<br />
destroying metal dust. Always loud hissing<br />
and        screeching, as of dying breaths,<br />
as bodies were tortured into shape</span></p></blockquote>
