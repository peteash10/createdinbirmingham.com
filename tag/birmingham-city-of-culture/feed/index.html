				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight on the One Show (7pm BBC, although it&#8217;ll inevitably be kept back until 7.29pm) we get to find out whether Birmingham gets to call itself City of Culture in 2013.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail has already called it for Londonderry (you&#8217;ll have to excuse the lack of link to that one) but we won&#8217;t know for sure until later. Win or not, I think the folks who ran the bid should be applauded for their efforts.</p>
<p>My fave aspect of the whole thing has been the unashamedly promotional posters on the London Underground. <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/dailybulletin/news2/2010/07/14/cbso-celebrates-a-record-season-as-audience-numbers-grow-65233-26854797/">Ed Vaizey said of the bid</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I see it on the Tube in London. It is a very entrepreneurial approach to raising the profile of the city across the UK</p></blockquote>
<p>Which was beautifully put. More of that sort of thing, I say.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/birminghamculture/4773528899/in/pool-1266516@N20/">a map&#8217;s been drawn up</a> to visualise some of the suggestions that were put forward through the Big Conversation and Talkeoke projects in the run up to the bid:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Visualisation Map Cultural Birmingham by Birmingham Culture, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/birminghamculture/4773528899/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4773528899_3f6d28178f.jpg" alt="Visualisation Map Cultural Birmingham" width="414" height="500" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Word&#8217;s been going round (although at the moment I can&#8217;t tell where from) that Thursday 15 July is decision day on the whole City of Culture 2013 thing.</p>
<p>While we work ourselves into barely-concealed bundles of anticipation, Arts Industry have done a quick <a href="http://www.artsindustry.co.uk/2010/07/05/city-of-the-future/">round-up of each city&#8217;s bid</a>. All much of a muchness, but recent events give the Derry bid a bit of topical oomph.</p>
<p>The Birmingham Post have <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2010/07/01/birmingham-city-of-culture-plans-revealed-65233-26762066/">revealed some of the plans</a> that went into the Birmingham bid. The comments aren&#8217;t pretty but some people will never be happy and, until such time as we get the decision or see the whole bid, passing any sort of judgment&#8217;s a bit tricky really. I&#8217;m still intrigued by the autumn festival and would love to know who the big name guest curators might be (I think I heard preliminary approaches had been made).</p>
<p>Still, haven&#8217;t we had promises that, irrespective of the decision, all these events are going to go ahead regardless?</p>

<p>Nice idea this:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/whatson_focus.asp?showid=1677">Who Wants to Be&#8230;?</a> is a spontaneous, democratic, live theatrical experience where the public really do take control. People propose ideas, discuss, and then <strong>vote on how to spend the evening&#8217;s entire box-office takings</strong>: Donate it? Invest it? Gamble it? Waste it? Form a collective and make the best idea happen yourself? You, the audience, decide</p></blockquote>
<p>It says it&#8217;s inspired by <a href="http://birminghamculture.org/">Birmingham&#8217;s City of Culture bid</a>, rather than being part of it, although the <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com">Hippodrome</a> and <a href="http://www.wearefierce.org/">Fierce</a> (who are putting this together) have been involved in the official thing too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s on 11 June Tickets are a tenner and <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/whatson_focus.asp?showid=1677">they&#8217;re available here</a>.</p>

<p>The Birmingham Post&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/jonwalker121/status/11871951561">Jon Walker</a> spotted the above advert at Westminster tube station and this morning the paper (well, website) is reporting &#8216;<a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/dailybulletin/news2/2010/04/08/mps-sign-commons-motion-to-back-birmingham-city-of-culture-bid-65233-26203889/">MPs sign Commons motion to back Birmingham City of Culture bid</a>&#8216;. So how&#8217;s the bid going?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to gauge this. Thing is, we (as in, the people of Birmingham) aren&#8217;t going to be the  target of much of the promotional stuff because we&#8217;re not doing the  judging. You&#8217;d assume/hope the effort is being spent outside the city (like the   poster above).</p>
<p>Btw,  I should make it clear that I&#8217;m supportive of Birmingham&#8217;s City of  Culture bid and think it&#8217;d be great to get the award.</p>
<p>So far, around Birmingham, I&#8217;ve seen a stack of flyers (at the Council  House), a few adverts in various brochures and&#8230; well that&#8217;s been about it. On the plus side, I&#8217;ve not seen much of the usual trick of tacking a logo on to anything vaguely within grasp.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see how the city is being sold to others, though.  Which of the city&#8217;s strengths are being pushed forward? Bearing in mind the branding looks like it&#8217;s been recycled from a luxury watch marketing campaign, I&#8217;m guessing the Jewellery Quarter (and by association, the city&#8217;s industrial heritage) features in some way. What else?</p>
<p>Most visible from our perspective is the online stuff. Here&#8217;s what the various cities are doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birmingham &#8211; <a href="http://birminghamculture.org">website</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Big-Blank-Canvas/221401070725">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bhamculture2013">Twitter</a></li>
<li>Derry/Londonderry &#8211; <a href="http://www.cityofculture2013.com/">website</a> (congrats on the cheeky URL), <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/City-of-Culture-2013/248928727507">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Norwich2013">Twitter</a></li>
<li>Norwich &#8211; <a href="http://www.norwichcityofculture.co.uk/">website</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&amp;gid=355932398754#!/group.php?v=wall&amp;gid=355932398754">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Norwich2013">Twitter</a></li>
<li>Sheffield &#8211; <a href="http://www.sheffieldcityofculture.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sheffield-City-of-Culture/194649648888">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/shefcityculture">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The good news there is that Birmingham&#8217;s website is as bland, information-free and predictable as all the others. The Facebook/Twitter stuff is being done just as poorly as everyone else&#8217;s too. Sad to see the previously quite popular <a href="http://birminghamculture.org/have-your-say">canvasbirmingham.com</a> site was killed off though (with credits for the local folks who developed it removed).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not seen so much discussion (<a href="http://www.thestirrer.co.uk/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=5827">there&#8217;s this on the Stirrer</a>) so has anyone got any thoughts on all of this? Feel free to comment anonymously if you must.</p>
