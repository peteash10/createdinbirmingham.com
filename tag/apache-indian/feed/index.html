				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was having a flick around the <a href="http://canvasbirmingham.com/">Big City Blank Canvas</a> website last night &#8211; that&#8217;s the website to support the City of Culture bid. Since I last checked in the&#8217;ve added to the list of &#8216;advocates&#8217; for the bid. My eye was drawn to the <a href="http://canvasbirmingham.com/advocates/apache-indian/">profile for Apache Indian</a> &#8211; he&#8217;s one of the few that has actually contributed answers to the questions asked on the site.</p>
<p>Having toured the world and recorded with some of the biggest names going (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Indian">Wikipedia link here</a>), I think I remember hearing that he spends his time on community projects around Birmingham. His latest project is a venue of his own &#8211; Apache&#8217;s Bar on Corporation Street. This is his description of the place:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have had many cultural events at my place from Polish Nights, Reggae, Gospel and Bhangra etc. I have seen how music brings people together all over the world and want to achieve that here in Bham. There were small venues that supported live music in Birmingham, like the Hard Rock Cafe. All gone!! My place provides a platform for music and culture and will continue to promote how great our city is to the people of the city and the many visitors that come here that want to feel Birmingham culture which is unlike anywhere in the world! I dont think that there is anywhere else that can represent Birmingham like Apaches Bar. We also work with the community and hold school events etc. (we have a schools talent competition there this week, thursday). We also work with young offenders on the ISSP. Lots of work going on and lots more to do!! Remember we have set up this place regardless of a cultural bid. I have spent 20 years promoting the culture of Birmingham all over the world.Â  Apaches Bar will continue that work and many people will come and feel that positive spirit and energy!! My mission will not be complete until people see that Birmingham is the cultural capital of the world!</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, all this is secondary to the fact that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Moio5q_1b8o">Boom Shack-A-Lak</a> is my absolute, all time happy tune.</p>
