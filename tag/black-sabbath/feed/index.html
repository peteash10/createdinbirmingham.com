				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/41370-5-10-15-20-earths-dylan-carlson/">an interview with Earth (who&#8217;ve played Supersonic) on Pitchfork</a>. Talking about Black Sabbath:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pitchfork</em>: Have you ever had any kind of personal interaction with any of the Sabbath people?</p>
<p><em>Dylan Carlson, Earth</em>: No. Sabbath is from Birmingham, England and Tony Iommi supposedly came to a festival we played there once, but I didn&#8217;t actually see him. The two women who put on that festival are always trying to get the Birmingham City Council to recognize that it&#8217;s the city of heavy metal and put up a plaque or a statue to acknowledge it.</p>
<p><em>Pitchfork</em>: That&#8217;s not a bad idea.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This one knocked me back on my heels &#8211; a really (and I mean <em>really</em>) impressive company doing amazing work on, quite literally, some of the world&#8217;s biggest stages.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.specialz.co.uk/">Specialz Ltd</a> is Keith Owen and Dave Smith and they describe their company as a &#8216;Production Design and Manufacturing House&#8217;. That is to say that they make lights like these for Radiohead&#8217;s 2008 world tour:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3.jpg" rel="lightbox[4575]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4576" title="radiohead3" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3.jpg" alt="radiohead3" width="500" height="281" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/radiohead3-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve worked on sets for the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Pink, Girls Aloud, Kylie Minogue and U2. They also <a href="http://www.specialz.co.uk/blacksabbath.html">refurbished the Black Sabbath Cross from 1981</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Acquired as a piece of Black Sabbath  				memorabilia by Music Superstore PMT<span> </span>The Black Sabbath Cross found it’s way in the Specialz  				Workshop for a refit.<span> </span>The Birmingham branch of PMT Music store plan to hang the  				piece, dating from 1981 tour, in the shop.<span> </span>However, with most of fittings missing and the fact  				they’d have to sell twice as many instruments to pay the  				electricity bill if it was rebuilt with the original light  				sources.</p>
<p>Keith Owen, Specialz Technical Director,  				sourced some obsolete spinnings and repopulated the piece with  				60 1.5w LED clusters which only draw a total of 300w max.<span> </span>He then used a prismatic lens to amplify the light  				output.</p></blockquote>
<p>Impressive stuff. They do art installations and all sorts too. In fact, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much they can&#8217;t do and the reports I&#8217;ve found on them elsewhere are glowing &#8211; <a href="www.i-pix.uk.com/downloads/RadioheadArticleUSA.pdf">there&#8217;s a PDF here</a> which effusively explains their role in the Radiohead stage set.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Normally I&#8217;d avoid mentioning (or thinking about) the desperate cry-for-attention that is Broad Street&#8217;s Walk of Stars, but the Capsule ladies have managed to find a pretty compelling angle to the latest addition.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi">Tony Iommi</a> &#8211; guitarist for Black Sabbath &#8211; is the next person to be honoured, which ties in nicely with the <a href="http://www.homeofmetal.com/">Home of Metal</a> project:</p>
<blockquote><p>Home of Metal encourages fans of  Black Sabbath  to be photographed wearing their prized band t-shirts.Â  Images will be taken by the Birmingham photographer Steve Gerrard. The photographs will then go on display on the Home Of Metal website and in future exhibitions.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s all happening on 23 Nov at 6.30pm, with Kerrang hosting live bands in Centenary Square earlier in the afternoon.Â  More info on the <a href="http://blog.homeofmetal.com/2008/11/19/tony-iommi-rocks-onto-the-walk-of-star%E2%80%99s-this-november-23rd/">Home of Metal blog</a>.</p>
<p>Capsule are hosting <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/event/racebannon">Racebannon + Trencher + Dream Dreams The Dreamer</a> at the Hare &amp; Hounds later that evening. They&#8217;ve also got <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/event/clinic">Clinic</a> at the Factory Club tomorrow (Thurs) night.</p>
<p>Last word goes to Tony (from the <a href="http://www.walkofstars.co.uk/?p=151">Walk of Stars website</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: black;">Itâ€™s great â€“ itâ€™s really an honour â€“ Iâ€™m really proud of it â€¦ I was shocked!Â  Itâ€™s so nice to have things like that! Iâ€™ve got one out in LA but Iâ€™m not from LA â€“ Itâ€™s so nice being recognised in your home townâ€</span></p></blockquote>
