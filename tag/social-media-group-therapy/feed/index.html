				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not really one for reprinting press releases that are sent to me but I&#8217;ll make an exception. Here follows a message from <a title="Pete Ashton on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/peteashton">Pete</a>.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running a couple of courses which I hope will become regular monthly things.</p>
<p>The first is <a title="Matt and Pete's Photography School" href="http://ash10.com/photo-school/">Matt and Pete&#8217;s Photo School</a> (see <a title="Photo School Poster" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Photo-School-poster.jpg" rel="lightbox[11496]">poster</a>)</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;re combining an academic approach to photography with the the practical peer learning of a Flickrmeet. As well as hobbyists we&#8217;re also looking to help those who can use photography better in their businesses or as a personal development course.</p>
<blockquote><p>Through a combination of group teaching, personal goal setting, one-to-one mentoring and peer learning, Matt and Pete can help you become a better photographer, whether it’s for photos of your family or as a valuable business tool.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first class in on Sunday Feb 6th at The Victoria from 12-5pm. The usual cost is £60 per head but we&#8217;re doing an introductory offer of £25 for February.</p>
<p>The second is <a title="Social Media Group Therapy" href="http://ash10.com/social-media-group-therapy/">Social Media Group Therapy</a> (see <a title="SocMed Group Therapy poster" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/SocMedGroupTherapy-poster.pdf">PDF poster</a>).</p>
<p>This is run with the Moseley Exchange and is aimed at the self-employed and small businesses who are having issues with their online activity. &#8220;Group therapy&#8221; isn&#8217;t just a joke. I think people&#8217;s problems, once unpicked, can be best be answered by those facing the same situations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Social Media Group Therapy avoids the snake oil and magic beans of fly-by-night “experts” with a structured environment of peer learning led by someone who understands the pros and cons of the online world.</p></blockquote>
<p>This course is on Tuesday March 6th at the Moseley Exchange from 6-8pm and costs £25 per person (£20 for Exchange members).</p>
