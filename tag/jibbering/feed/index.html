<p>I was browsing the internet a couple of years ago and I came across a little character with a yellow t-shirt and a red cap.  I thought he was pretty cool and used him as my avatar on Facebook and Twitter for a while.  I didn&#8217;t think much more of it.</p>
<p>Then the other day I was browsing the <a href="http://www.jibberingart.co.uk/">Jibbering Art</a> website to see what they had on offer and, lo and behold, I came across some prints by that same artist &#8211; <a href="http://www.tomlewis.co.uk/news.htm">Tom Lewis</a>.</p>
<p>He was born in Birmingham and works as an artist and illustrator in Warwick.  If asked how he&#8217;s ended up where he has he&#8217;ll tell you that</p>
<blockquote><p>The story is too long            to be told now although, briefly, it led to the creation of a mythological            18th century French philosopher, the forging of a sword and the images            that you see today.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tomlewis.co.uk/pages/pr_mrtilly.htm">Mr Tilly</a> at the top there.  Prints are available from his own site and from <a href="http://www.jibberingart.co.uk/artwork/?brand=15">Jibbering Art</a>.</p>

<p>Two things to report from Jibbering, Moseley&#8217;s creative dervishes.  Firstly they recently launched an exhibition called The Paper Market which showcases</p>
<blockquote><p>limited edition prints by many of the finest contemporary urban artists, illustrators, designers &amp; photographers from within and around Birmingham.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>explores the blossoming movement of incredible art that reflects the vibrant and diverse subculture that exists in the city today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the exhibition also heralds the launch of the <a href="http://www.jibberingart.co.uk/">Jibbering Art</a> website which is worth perusal.</p>
<p>Alright, one last thing.  Their <a href="http://www.jibbering.co.uk/content/blogcategory/21/51/">next event</a> on Saturday 7 June at the Hare &amp; Hounds looks very cool.  They&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.antisocialclub.co.uk/">Smerins Anti-Social Club</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/meyoubrighton">Me &amp; You</a> (check their cover of Brown Paper Bag) and Mr Muz &amp; DJ Feva from <a href="http://www.munchbreak.com/">Munchbreak</a>.</p>
<p>**Update** Graeme from Boxer Design went to have a look round the exhibition yesterday and has put plentyÂ  photos up on Boxer&#8217;s blog &#8211; <a href="http://www.boxerthinkbeyond.co.uk/soakitup/?p=518">Soak It Up</a>.</p>
