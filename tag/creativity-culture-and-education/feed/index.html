				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know the deal by now. I witter on about cuts to arts funding and make up for it all with a picture of a bunny at the end. Only this time it&#8217;s a video.</p>
<p>Now, the good thing about writing this twelve hours after today&#8217;s announcement is that everyone else has summarised, pontificated and moved on. I can just link to what they&#8217;ve written. Blogging is ace. Anyway, onward&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/across-board-69-cut-funding-arts-organisations-201/">Arts Council&#8217;s announcement</a>. Fair play to them for getting this out in reasonably good time following the spending review.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.audiencescentral.co.uk/news/?id=897">Audiences Central have summarised things</a> and the <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2010/10/26/rsc-to-lose-1m-in-funding-as-arts-council-cuts-hit-west-midlands-65233-27547754/">Birmingham Post has calculated the cuts</a> the region&#8217;s orgs are going to face from April 2011.</p>
<p>To skip through the announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/regular-funding-organisations/">regularly funded organisations</a> will have their funding cut by 6.9% in 2011/2012</li>
<li>By 2014/15 cuts will have risen to 14.9% in real terms (ie. ignoring inflation)</li>
<li><a href="http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/">Arts and Business</a> and <a href="http://www.creativitycultureeducation.org/">Creativity, Culture and Education</a> will have their public funding halved next year and taken away completely the year after that. That&#8217;s very bad news for them</li>
<li>The Arts Council will have to halve its admin costs</li>
<li>There&#8217;ll be a new system for funding from 2012 onwards (arrangements to be announced 4 November 2010). Everyone will have to reapply &#8211; some existing orgs won&#8217;t be successful, some new ones will</li>
<li>The budget for budget for &#8216;strategic opportunities for artistic work&#8217; such as touring, large events and the Cultural Leadership Programme is being knocked down by 64%</li>
</ul>
<p>Next year will be a &#8216;transition year&#8217;, hence the lower-than-expected cuts, the stay of execution for A&amp;B and CCE and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/oct/26/arts-bodies-face-budget-cuts?CMP=twt_gu">the Guardian describing arts groups as &#8216;relieved&#8217;</a>. So expect things to get worse. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget the local authority funding that&#8217;s disappearing.</p>
<p>In A&amp;B&#8217;s &#8216;defence&#8217; Colin Tweedy has released <a href="http://artsandbusiness.org.uk/Home/News/2010/october/response-to-funding-decisions.aspx">an utterly unimpressive statement</a> quoting <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2010-10-25a.1.10&amp;s=speaker:10632#g3.0">an easily-swatted away question in Parliament</a> and referring to the generalised views of unnamed &#8216;private sector partners&#8217;. Go get em, tiger.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s not all bad news in the arts. Working at the top at the Royal Opera House <a href="http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/eadweardmuybridge/media/k2/items/cache/media/k2/items/cache/templates/artsdesk2009/images/plugins/system/jceutilities/themes/standard/css/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2465:royal-opera-house-chief's-%C2%A3630000-salary&amp;Itemid=105">can net you Â£630,000 a year</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsBbE7c2P28">the bunny vid</a>:</p>
