				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/" target="_blank">Creative Republic</a> invites you to join them at 6.30pm on 30th March to hear direct from those who went to Texas as part of the city’s <a href="http://sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SXSW</a> Music delegation.</p>
<div class="post"><img class="aligncenter" title="sxsw" src="http://images.google.co.uk/url?source=imgres&amp;ct=img&amp;q=http://www.intuitive.com/blog/images/sxsw-logo.png&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2OuYyLdiGewAAsiIirUUgv8uX0g" alt="" width="237" height="226" /></p>
<p>Now in its 23rd year, SXSW Music has grown from a tiny music festival in Texas to an essential event on the music industry calendar. It’s four hyperactive days of making connections for musicians, recording companies and every other business touching on music, from concert bookers to copyright lawyers, publishers to social media types. Creative Republic thought this would be an ideal opportunity to find out what the Birmingham team’s experiences were and what they’ve learned.</p>
<p>As the dust settles on the old way of doing things for the music industry, has SXSW shone some light on a new model?</p>
<p>They have lined up Kerry Thomas and Dave O’Coy from <a href="http://www.fusedmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Fused</a> and        Lisa Meyer and Jenny Moore from <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/" target="_blank">Capsule</a>, amongst others who are ready to        be quizzed. Leading the quizzing will be <a href="http://newmusicstrategies.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Dubber</a> and <a href="http://johnmostyn.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">John  Mostyn</a>.</p>
<p>So you might want to ask them a question or two as well. Timings        for the event are:</p>
<ul>
<li>6.30pm Arrival; cash bar available</li>
<li>7-8pm Panel discussion and questions</li>
<li>8-9pm Networking and event close.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no charge for attending but they do ask for you to sign the <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/charter" target="_blank">Creative Republic Charter</a>, and to <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/lists/creativerepublic/lt.php?id=KUpXD1EZVUgLAg%3D%3D" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. A map and directions for        the venue can be found at <a href="http://www.creativerepublic.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.creativerepublic.org.uk</a>.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/deluka.jpg" rel="lightbox[1624]"><img class="alignright alignnone size-medium wp-image-1625" style="float: right;" title="deluka" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/deluka.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="98" /></a></p>
<p>Computer games and individual bands are outside the traditional remit of CiB but this is a bit too cool to not warrant a mention.  According to their <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/music/showcases/band/62048.html">bio on the SXSW website</a>, local band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deluka">Deluka</a> have somehow managed to get their song &#8216;Sleep Is Impossible&#8217; featured on the next installment of the Grand Theft Auto series.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t spend their days complaining about their parents and/or hiding in their bedrooms, the Grand Theft Auto franchise has sold 70 million units to date &#8211; making it as popular as Tetris but much more controverisal.  GTA 4 is due out imminently and likely to be one of the biggest-selling computer games released this year.</p>
<p>So congrats to Deluka.  You can check out their obligatory <a href="http://http//www.myspace.com/deluka">MySpace page</a> and you can also go see them at The Barfly on 29 April supporting another rather decent local band, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/envyandothersins">Envy &amp; Other Sins</a>. I understand the gig will be reviewed and photographed by the guys at <a href="http://www.brumlive.com">Birmingham Live!</a> too.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://antoniogould.com/">Antonio</a> for the heads up.</p>
