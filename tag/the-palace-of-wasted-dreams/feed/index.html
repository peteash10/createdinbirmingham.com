This participatory musical theatre project explores women’s relationship with alcohol, and is the culmination of a two-year project called <em>Wasted</em>.</p>
<p>Women &amp; Theatre are holding a development weekend on 6 and 7 November at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">mac</a> from 11am – 4pm, where you can find out more about the project. After previewing some of the scenes and songs you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to sign up as part of the cast. It&#8217;s not an audition, and you don&#8217;t need to have any previous experience &#8211; a perfect chance to try something new for 2011 perhaps?</p>
<p>All they ask is that you can dedicate the time and commit to rehearsal and performance dates, which can be found over on <a href="http://www.womenandtheatre.co.uk/2010/11/01/become-part-of-our-community-cast-for-the-palace-of-wasted-dreams-development-weekend-6th-7th-november/">their website</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get involved in the production, both on stage or back stage, contact Pippa Frith on <strong>0121 440 4203</strong> or email <a title="mailto:pippafrith@womenandtheatre.co.uk" href="mailto:pippafrith@womenandtheatre.co.uk">pippafrith@womenandtheatre.co.uk</a></p>
