<p style="text-align: left;">Today (14th February) sees the start of <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/" target="_blank">New Art West Midlands</a> 2014. It was announced in December that 24 emerging artists from our own regional universities would exhibit their work within four different galleries across Birmingham and Wolverhampton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.tpwestmidlands.org.uk/">A Turning Point West Midlands</a> initiative, New Art West Midlands exhibits the work of 24 artists, all of whom have graduated from one of the region’s undergraduate and postgraduate fine art degree courses in the past three years: Birmingham City University, Coventry University, Staffordshire University, University of Wolverhampton and University of Worcester.  Encompassing four nationally important galleries plus five universities, it is the largest partnership of its kind in England.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Who are the Artists?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of the artists have recently come from undergraduate and postgraduate courses. There really is a great range of different artists <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/nawm-2014" target="_blank">here</a>, with their work ranging from sculpture, film, photography, performance to painting.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://barber.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://barber.org.uk/our-governance/">The Barber Institute Steering Committee</a> is chaired by the University of Birmingham’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Professor Michael Whitby as well as representatives from the University’s College of Arts and Law, the Henry Barber Trust and the Friends of the Barber Institute. The Barber Institute of Fine Arts owes its existence to the vision of Dame Martha Constance Hattie Barber (1869–1933). First opened by Queen Mary in 1939, the art deco building owes its design to architect Robert Atkinson (1833-1952) and has since been a home to major art collections, a public gallery and the original concert hall for the University of Birmingham. Their collection includes paintings by Old Masters including Botticelli, Rubens, Gainsborough and Turner, as well as Impressionist and other 19th and 20th-century masterpieces by Monet, Degas, Renoir and Magritte.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Barber Institute will be exhibiting the work of Caroline Ali, James Birkin, Sade Buckle, Leah Carless, Cheryl Howard, Sikander Pervez, Glen Stoker, Wendy Ann Titmus and Chris Wright from the 14<sup>th </sup>February – 27<sup>th </sup>April.

Based at 19 Minerva Works in Fazeley, Grand Union is an exciting artist-led project space that houses 8 purpose built studios (and they really are lovely!) which were designed by designer Matthew Higginbottom with <a href="http://queenandcrawford.com/" target="_blank">Queen &amp; Crawford</a>. As well as exhibiting the works from the Turning Point West Midlands artists, Grand Union will also be hosting a talk on the <a href="http://grand-union.org.uk/gallery/artists-talk-new-art-west-midlands-2014/" target="_blank">17<sup>th</sup> February</a> from 6:30pm till 8:00pm featuring artists Leah Carless, Sarah Sehra, Anna Smith, Glen Stoker and Hannah Sutherland.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/" target="_blank">Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery</a> opened on 28th November 1885. Birmingham’s citizens had campaigned for a Corporation Art Gallery for over 40 years. The generosity of manufacturers such as Thomas Clarkson Osler, Richard and George Tangye, and Mayors Joseph and Richard Chamberlain, secured the art gallery for the town. Now funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and Birmingham City Council it now boasts over 500,000 objects to make up the numerous collections that originate from each of the continents and dating from 200,000 years ago to the modern day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Having recently held the successful Photorealism Exhibition (still open until 30<sup>th</sup> March) they will be exhibiting the Turning Point West Midland’s Artists from the 14<sup>th</sup> February – 18<sup>th</sup> May.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/" target="_blank">Wolverhampton Art Gallery</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/">WAVE</a> is a collection of buildings.

Wolverhampton Art Gallery has a range of collections and regularly exhibits new works, including contemporary pieces as well as grand paintings dating back as far as the 18<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not only is Wolverhampton Art Gallery a great resource for artworks, they are also involved with their community, regularly running events and workshops that are open to the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wolverhampton Art Gallery is open from Monday – Saturday between the hours of 10am – 5pm. They will be exhibiting the work of Sade Buckle, Sharon Farrelly, Amelia Greville, Emily Mulenga, Sarah Sehra, Anna Smith and Wendy Ann Titmus.
