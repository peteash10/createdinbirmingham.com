<p>Hold it Down Productions have launched an attempt to break a world record for the largest orchestra. Together with conductor <a href="http://www.charleshazlewood.com">Charles Hazlewood</a> and composer <a href="http://www.tombassett.co.uk/">Tom Basset</a>, the <a href="http://worldslargestorchestra.org">Worlds Largest Orchestra</a> will play at the LG Arena on 24 October in aid of <a href="http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/">Marie Curie Cancer Care</a>.</p>
<p>At 12 minutes long, the piece entitled &#8220;Dawn to Dusk&#8221;, is one of the largest orchestrated pieces in history. The aim is to gather 7,000 musicians of all standards, involving all instruments, in order to break the current record which sits with over 6,000 musicians, set in May 2000 by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to be involved in this ridiculously huge event, take a look around their website for <a href="http://worldslargestorchestra.org/the-team/48">further information</a> and register yourself as part of the orchestra.</p>
<p>Cheers to <a href="http://twitter.com/rjphawley/status/25010474346">Richard Hawley</a> for flagging this up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was really touched by what Chris wrote about Baldy&#8217;s Blog in his <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2009/01/15/created-in-birmingham-best-uk-blog-2008/#comments" target="_blank">thank you post</a> last Thursday. It got me thinking that if we could harness the huge support of the creative community which made it possible for CiB to win an award, what could we do if we used that support within project which would affect people who need it most, for example a charity?</p>
<p>When I was looking at Ben Javens&#8217;s website shop yesterday I had a flash of inspiration. Here is my idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brum&#8217;s best known 2D artists donate an original image, drawing, photograph etc. to CiB</li>
<li>CiB sets up an online shop using a website service  like <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Press</a>.<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/" target="_blank"><br />
</a></li>
<li>CiB sells limited edition t shirts,  canvas bags, pin badges etc which sport the original images</li>
<li>All the profits go to a Birmingham based charity suggested by you, the CiB readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that is the bare bones of an idea which could be made into a rather nice charity project, with a bit of your help. What I am asking you, the readers is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would anyone like to offer an image / illustration to be used?</li>
<li>Can anyone recommended a Cafe Press type service?</li>
<li>Most importantly: What Birmingham based charity could the proceeds go to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answers in  the comments please! Any other ideas / comments gratefully received.</p>
