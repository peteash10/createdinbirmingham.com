				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the cockles of my heart &#8211; how they are warmed.</p>
<p>Created in Birmingham doesn&#8217;t tend to cover comedy very much although, as people have pointed out, there&#8217;s no lack of creativity going on with it.Â  The problem is that, although I come across plenty of listings, there&#8217;s been no-one (that I&#8217;ve found) writing passionately and consistently about the city&#8217;s comedy scene.</p>
<p>Until now &#8211; enter <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">Who&#8217;s Laughing Now?</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" rel="lightbox[2157]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2158" title="whoslaughingnow" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="408" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With news, listings, features and a kind of curation area for YouTube vids, it&#8217;s been launched to coincide with the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> and is the brainchild of Rich Batsford and Simon Harper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.richbatsford.com/?p=309">Rich explains on his own blog</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The site has been created with the intent of developing the comedy scene in the area and is more or less an open forum &#8211; we are very happy for all local promoters to send in previews of their events.</p>
<p>We are also on the lookout for other writers or budding journalists who are interested in publishing reviews through the site. Whilst thereâ€™s no money on offer, its all good experience and we would expect to be able to get free show tickets for our contributors when they are reviewing a show. Are you interested? &#8211; please <a href="mailto:info@whoslaughingnow.org">contact us</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really chuffed to see this and think there&#8217;s a whole heap of potential here, so good luck to them.</p>
