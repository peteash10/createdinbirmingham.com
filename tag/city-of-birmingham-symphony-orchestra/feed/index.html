				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/sustain/">Sustain fund</a> but still, an award&#8217;s an award, innit?</p>
<blockquote><p>Arts Council England has made a seventh round of awards from its £40 million Sustain fund for organisations under pressure as a result of the recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra:</p>
<blockquote><p>The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s application met the Sustain criteria as the Orchestra has been adversely impacted by the recession. As such, we have offered a Sustain award of £388,000 to maintain the quality of artistic output and resolve immediate cash flow problems caused by loss of development income and touring income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Warwick Arts Centre:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elements of Warwick Arts Centre’s application have been judged to meet the Sustain criteria. As such, we have offered a Sustain award of £215,000 to help the organisation with the adverse impact of the recession by maintaining the quality of artistic output and resolve immediate cash flow problems caused by loss of income from box office, trusts and foundations.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other news, the Arts Council get their website redesigned and then go hiding all their information in Word docs, PDF&#8217;s and Excel spreadsheets. Irritating.</p>
