				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time a disgruntled promoter will write something accusing the people of Birmingham of being an apathetic bunch who&#8217;d rather stay at home than go out and have a good time. See <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/02/05/a-round-up-of-some-recent-music-discussions/">this post from a year ago</a> for an example.</p>
<p>James Cook has joined this cohort with a post titled &#8216;<a title="Post detail page of &quot;Why the Birmingham comedy scene repeatedly dies on its hole...&quot;" href="http://nottheexplorer.blog.co.uk/2011/02/28/why-the-birmingham-comedy-scene-repeatedly-dies-on-its-hole-10718505/">Why the Birmingham comedy scene repeatedly dies on its hole&#8230;</a>&#8216;. His gripes are that (and I apologise for paraphrasing):</p>
<ul>
<li>research shows that residents of Birmingham are the most risk averse in the country. We have a drinking culture, but not much of a &#8216;going out&#8217; culture. This makes things difficult for promoters</li>
<li>there are too many poor quality comedy night charging people good money to see new, unpaid acts. These nights are rubbish and will put people off ever going to a comedy night again</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim to know too much about this &#8211; I go to the occasional stand-up show, but I don&#8217;t have James&#8217;s experience of the local comedy scene and he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.capsule.org.uk/blog/2010/01/28/engaging-regional-audiences-how-do-we-do-it/#comment-32039877">not the first</a> to have made this complaint. However, from a lay punter&#8217;s point of view, I was under the impression that if comedy&#8217;s your thing then Birmingham caters for you pretty well. We&#8217;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.thenia.co.uk/">NIA</a> and <a href="http://www.lgarena.co.uk/">LG Arena</a> for the big, mainstream touring shows</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk">Town Hall</a> and <a href="http://www.alexandratheatre.org.uk/">Alexandra Theatre</a> for other biggish touring shows</li>
<li>two main stand-up venues &#8211; <a href="http://www.glee.co.uk/">The Glee Club</a> and <a href="http://www.thehighlight.co.uk/birmingham/upcoming-shows">Highlight</a></li>
<li>other occasional shows at <a href="http://www.thepublic.com/">The Public</a> and the <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk/">MAC</a>. <a href="http://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/">Warwick Arts Centre</a> and various places in Wolverhampton are fairly close too</li>
<li>some smaller, regular nights bringing in some decent national names (<a href="http://www.comedyjunction.co.uk/">Comedy Junction</a> and <a href="http://www.popcorncomedy.com/category/locations/birmingham/">Popcorn Comedy</a>)</li>
<li>there&#8217;s a proliferation of other, smaller nights at pubs and bars around over the city too</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of general promotion, we&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">dedicated comedy website</a> and (almost?) every year the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> draws a ring around a load of shows happening over the space of a month and shouts about them.</p>
<p>That seems like a pretty healthy spread to me. Certainly a good deal more than many other towns and cities can claim. Does it constitute a &#8216;scene&#8217;? If not, is it just the audiences for the smaller gigs that are missing, or something else?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested in hearing what people think. Or, seeing as how he started the discussion, leave a comment on <a href="http://nottheexplorer.blog.co.uk/2011/02/28/why-the-birmingham-comedy-scene-repeatedly-dies-on-its-hole-10718505/">James&#8217;s post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now.jpg" rel="lightbox[3931]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3933" title="Who’s Laughing Now" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now.jpg" alt="Who’s Laughing Now" width="500" height="197" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Who’s-Laughing-Now-300x118.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Listings come from <a href="http://www.livebrum.co.uk/genres/comedy">Live Brum</a> (although they&#8217;re not coming through quite right at the mo, so check Live Brum itself), news comes from <a href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/">Chortle</a> and they add their own news, previews and reviews. Their <a href="http://twitter.com/whoslaughingnow">Twitter account</a> puts out a weekly top tip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glee.co.uk/index.php?id_page=183&amp;id_club=1">The Glee Club</a> and <a href="http://bookings.jongleurs.com/jongleurs/venues/21/birmingham">Jongleurs</a> are the main venues around town so it&#8217;s worth browsing their listings too, just in case.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the cockles of my heart &#8211; how they are warmed.</p>
<p>Created in Birmingham doesn&#8217;t tend to cover comedy very much although, as people have pointed out, there&#8217;s no lack of creativity going on with it.Â  The problem is that, although I come across plenty of listings, there&#8217;s been no-one (that I&#8217;ve found) writing passionately and consistently about the city&#8217;s comedy scene.</p>
<p>Until now &#8211; enter <a href="http://www.whoslaughingnow.org/">Who&#8217;s Laughing Now?</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" rel="lightbox[2157]"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2158" title="whoslaughingnow" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="408" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow.jpg 500w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/whoslaughingnow-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With news, listings, features and a kind of curation area for YouTube vids, it&#8217;s been launched to coincide with the <a href="http://www.bhamcomfest.co.uk/">Birmingham Comedy Festival</a> and is the brainchild of Rich Batsford and Simon Harper.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.richbatsford.com/?p=309">Rich explains on his own blog</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The site has been created with the intent of developing the comedy scene in the area and is more or less an open forum &#8211; we are very happy for all local promoters to send in previews of their events.</p>
<p>We are also on the lookout for other writers or budding journalists who are interested in publishing reviews through the site. Whilst thereâ€™s no money on offer, its all good experience and we would expect to be able to get free show tickets for our contributors when they are reviewing a show. Are you interested? &#8211; please <a href="mailto:info@whoslaughingnow.org">contact us</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really chuffed to see this and think there&#8217;s a whole heap of potential here, so good luck to them.</p>
