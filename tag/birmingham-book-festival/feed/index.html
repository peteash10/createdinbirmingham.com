<p>Now in its 14th edition, <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org">Birmingham Book Festival</a> will be kicking off this year with a bevy of shindigs, including  <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/all-night-at-the-locksmiths-house-3751/">all night writing sessions</a>, <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/bookshop-opens-3880/">pop-up book shops</a> and workshops; spanning everything from <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/the-new-libya-its-writers-3792/">blogging in Libya</a> to a session on <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/tindal-street-press-narrative-voice-quick-workshop-3768/">finding your own Narrative voice by local print house Tindal Street Press</a>.</p>
<p>The main festival gets things rolling on the 29th September, with a <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/the-launch-party-3878/">Launch Party on the 4th October</a>, that has associated and Fringe events taking place all the way up to the 13th October.  There is so much happening, that you really are best to <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/events-2012/full-festival-programme/">check out the programme</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/BhamBookFest">their Twitter feed</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;but in my opinion, the unparalleled option to keep abreast of the fest, is to <strong><a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/events-2012/birmingham-book-festival-app/">download their app</a></strong>! iPhone and iPad only at present, the app will give you maps, listings and news to your device. Pretty nifty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Books, the bookish, the book; there’s never been a better time to talk about them. Not sitting here there hasn’t, anyway. Indicators are everywhere: books are in flux. Turnover in book publishing is growing slowly, but exports are accounting for a bigger share of the market. Micro-publishers are flourishing yet so are Ebooks. A decline in High Street retail activity may see Waterstone’s go to the wall. Never mind Peak Oil, what about Peak Book? Are we living through a tipping point? Have we seen the apogee of ink on paper, the high point of the printed word?</p>
<p>It’s difficult to say. Especially given the research I’ve done for this piece. One thing’s certain though: that’s the introduction out of the way. So. Maybe now we can get to the point. And a giddy, feel-good, non-critical point it is too&#8230;</p>
<p>There’s a real slobbery bounce about the Birmingham literary scene at the mo, but a balance of vitamins and minerals as well. This spring we have news of everything from the latest release of an internationally renowned Brummie author to the ongoing investment in our creative future.</p>
<p>I’ll start with the former and a writer who – as a nominally ‘genre’ novelist &#8211; you may not have encountered. <a href="http://www.rogerjonellory.com/default.aspx">Roger Ellory</a> lives in Yardley and when he was a teenager he was sent to jail for poaching. He wrote twenty-three novels before he sold his first; now he can’t stop bagging French crime-writing awards. His new book is due soon in paperback.</p>
<p>If you prefer murder to homicide – and a considerably more sober author biog to boot – the ever-dependable independent player <a href="http://www.tindalstreet.co.uk/">Tindal Street Press</a> present the first in a new series from former ‘young adult’ author David Belbin. You can read an extract here: <a href="http://www.tindalstreet.co.uk/news/sneak-peak-of-crime-novel-bone-and-cane">http://www.tindalstreet.co.uk/news/sneak-peak-of-crime-novel-bone-and-cane</a></p>
<p>‘Fiction reveals truths that reality obscures’ said Jessamyn West, Quaker author and cousin of Richard Nixon. And if you think that’s bobbins, then you may be interested in what Candi Miller has to say on the matter. The author of ‘Salt and Honey’ opens Birmingham Book Festival’s Spring Thing on 9th April with a workshop that looks at ‘<a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/workshop-truth-lies-life-writing-candi-miller-1070/">Truth, Lies and life Writing</a>’. The Festival’s ongoing work includes the <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/write-on/">Write On!</a> initiative, taking place in schools across the region; among the writers involved is adopted Brummie Helen Cross, who wrote ‘My Summer of Love’ and ‘Spilt Milk, Black Coffee’ and claims to find her inspiration on West Midlands Travel buses.</p>
<p>A bit prosaic? Then I’ll finish with Kings-Heath based author <a href="http://www.dedalusbooks.com/top.php?id=174&amp;s=4">Andrew Killeen</a>. His novels revisit and reinterpret Persian myths. His second is due out in August and I defy you to read its opening and not start counting the days:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a story to tell you. It is a tale of adventure, of love, and deception, of destiny and death. It is a tale of kings, and emperors, and of beautiful princesses; but also of poets, pirates, and priests. It is a story to entertain and instruct, to stir the blood, to inflame the senses, to dizzy the mind and rouse the soul&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>By Charlie Hill</p>
<p><em>Charlie Hill lives and works in Kings Heath. His first novel – The Space Between Things – is set in Moseley. <a href="http://www.charliehill.org.uk/reviews-and-praise.html">www.charliehill.org.uk</a></em></p>

<p>Published by <a href="http://punch-records.co.uk/">Punch</a> and <a href="http://www.oomgallery.net/">OOM Gallery</a>, Birmingham based photographer Pogus Caesar is releasing a book entitled &#8216;<a href="http://punch-records.co.uk/2010/08/11/muzik-kinda-sweet/">Musik Kinda Sweet</a>&#8216;, which collects his iconic photographs of black performers over the last twenty five years.</p>
<p>This evocative and nostalgic book captures candid snaps on the city streets, along with the contrasting vibrant energy by the stage, including photographs of Stevie Wonder, Lee &#8216;Scratch&#8217; Perry, Grace Jones and Jay-Z. All of his images were shot on 35mm black and white film, with each negative developed by hand &#8211; a far cry from today&#8217;s heavily digital performance photography.</p>
<p>The book launch will take place as part of <a href="http://www.birminghambookfestival.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BBF-COMPLETE-LR.pdf">Birmingham Book Festival</a> on 15 October on 6.45pm at <a href="http://www.macarts.co.uk">mac</a>&#8216;s Terrace Gallery.</p>
<p>Signed copies of the book will be available to buy via the <a href="http://punch-records.co.uk/shop/muzik-kinda-sweet-pogus-ceasar-signed-copy/">Punch website</a> from 16 October.</p>

Birmingham Book Festival takes place from 6th -29th October in various venues across the city. PixieSixer rounds up the highlights</li>
<li><a href="http://www.regenwm.org/events/event_details.asp?eid=656">RegenWM &#8211; Seminar &#8211; Culture and regneration, 22 October 2009</a></li>
<li> &#8220;This seminar will explore what culture and sport mean to individuals, communities and cities and how they can be harnessed to support regeneration outcomes&#8221;. Worth a look, especially as it&#8217;s free &#8211; &#8220;In response to the current economic climate the RegenWM Board has decided that RegenWM&#8217;s seminar series will be free of charge until the end of March 2010&#8221;. Good on them</li>
<li><a href="http://propperganda.wordpress.com/tag/birmingham/">Propperganda</a><br />
Propperganda is Kev who writes about fashion, music, design, cycling and so on</li>
<li><a href="http://2sugarsplease.wordpress.com/2009/08/27/its-been-a-while/">Its been a while « Tea &amp; cake</a><br />
Tea &amp; Cake is a blog apparently written by a little tortoise. This tortoise went to Wagamamas and then the Electric Cinema, of which she says &#8220;i expected vintage popcorn boxes , maybe red curtains that opened or an oldish projector, even maybe a little vendor that serves things or tells you to ssshhhhh!!&#8221;</li>
