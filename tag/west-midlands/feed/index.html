				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s the day that arts organisations up and down the country will find out whether they&#8217;re going to receive funding over the next few years.</p>
<p>In case a bit of background&#8217;s useful, over the past few years, the <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/">Arts Council</a> funds organisations in two ways &#8211; by giving cash on a project-by-project basis (that&#8217;s called Grants for the Arts) and through what&#8217;s called &#8216;regular funding&#8217;. In the latter you&#8217;d be given an amount of money over a period of time.</p>
<p>The regular funding part is changing &#8211; as from this time next year, there will be a number of organisations that will be known as National Portfolio Organisations. Today we&#8217;re finding out which those will be.</p>
<p><strong>Headline figures:</strong></p>
<p>Nationally, 695 organisations have National Portfolio status (down from around 880 that had regular funding previously). 206 organisations that were regularly funded didn&#8217;t make it into the portfolio. 110 organisations that weren&#8217;t regularly funded have got in.</p>
<p>In the West Midlands (and according to my rather iffy maths) we&#8217;ve gone from 66 regularly funded organisations to 50 National Portfolio Organisations.</p>
<h3>National Portfolio Organisations in the West Midlands</h3>
<p>As my first boss always told me &#8211; always work from first sources. <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/national-portfolio-funding/">The official Arts Council info is here</a>. Of course, there&#8217;s only so much you can tell from a spreadsheet so the following won&#8217;t reveal much detail and may be slightly misleading in places (doesn&#8217;t take account of mergers or name changes). Still, this what I&#8217;ve made of it, and if I&#8217;ve made any mistakes, then please let me know (links are to statements put out by the orgs):</p>
<p><strong>Funding increased from current position</strong>:</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica} --></p>
<ul>
<li>Ace Dance And Music</li>

<li><a href="http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/?p=1517">Stan&#8217;s Cafe</a></li>
<li>Wolverhampton Arts and Museums Service</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that some of these increases reflect mergers with other organisations, while others (Stan&#8217;s Cafe for one) have requested funding for money that would previously have come via applications to Grants For The Arts Awards.</p>
<p><strong>Funding decreased</strong>:</p>

<p>As a side note, most of the reductions in funding here are <em>relatively</em> small. In a few cases they&#8217;re  a little more significant &#8211; check the spreadsheet for full info.</p>

<p><strong>Current RFOs that won&#8217;t be in the National Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>Please be aware that a lack of inclusion in the National Portfolio doesn&#8217;t mean these are just going to shut up shop. There&#8217;s also a couple of orgs here (flagged up where they&#8217;ve alerted me) who&#8217;s funding will come from one of those who <em>are</em> in the portfolio. Of course, some of these might well have not made an application, preferring to stick to project funding.</p>
