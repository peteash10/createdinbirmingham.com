I need to keep a closer eye on what happens over there (and maybe, y&#8217;know, get round to visiting at some point).</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.7inch.org.uk/news/2010/04/graham-vick-at-the-barber/">Ian from 7 Inch Cinema went along</a> and has blogged his notes. Lots of good things there, including:</p>
<blockquote><p>The arts in the UK are blighted with fearfulness, conservatism,  reactionary ordinariness. Our job is to build a more exciting, bolder  future than the past has been. There is no such thing as tradition. The  earth never stops moving. Stasis is a delusion. Be open to  changeability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, BOC are a currently <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/news_item.php?nid=115">rehearsing a new mini-production</a> of Stephen Oliver&#8217;s &#8216;A Man of Feeling&#8217;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;d be pointless me adding to the mounting pile of gushing reviews this performance is receiving, so I&#8217;m going to float an idea instead (which should give you an inkling of what I thought of it).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/graham_vick.html">Graham Vick</a> is the Artistic Director of <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/">Birmingham Opera Company</a>. Year-round he works with the world&#8217;s major operas and returns to Birmingham to let his imagination run riot. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to see one of his BOC productions he&#8217;ll be the guy with the look of impish enthusiasm ushering the audience around and mouthing the words.</p>
<p>Here are his notes from Othello&#8217;s programme:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/BOCnotes.jpg" rel="lightbox[4491]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4492" title="BOCnotes" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/BOCnotes.jpg" alt="BOCnotes" width="439" height="419" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/BOCnotes.jpg 439w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/BOCnotes-300x286.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>After the first night thousands hijacked Verdi&#8217;s carriage to parade him through the streets of Milan in triumph</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Birmingham owes Graham Vick the same treatment.</p>
<p>Othello is deservedly sold out. However, I&#8217;ve heard a rumour that the BBC will be filming the show for broadcast, so fingers crossed on that.</p>

Roger Shannon pays tribute to the late Isaac Hayes in an article most remarkable for the idea of a band consisting of Isaac Hayes, Huggy Bear and Taurean Blacque with Lovejoy as their manager.  Oh, scrap that &#8211; I just got to the bit where Roger auctioned Hayes&#8217; boxer shorts&#8230;</li>

They went and used a picture of Birmingham, Alabama&#8217;s skyline on a leaflet.Â  They seem to have used the first pic that came up when they searched &#8216;Birmingham skyline&#8217; with Google &#8211; not that they were prepared to admit that at first, which is probably why every man and their blog has written about this now.Â  Ah well.</li>
