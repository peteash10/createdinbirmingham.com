				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to write something on CiB?</p>
<p>We get plenty of emails from people wanting to contribute to the blog but the answer&#8217;s always the same &#8211; put that stuff on your own blog and perhaps we&#8217;ll link to it. Mainly that&#8217;s because CiB&#8217;s always been about encouraging others to have their own outlets for expression.</p>
<p>We probably won&#8217;t be able to post <em>everything</em> but maybe this&#8217;ll turn into a regular thing. Or maybe we&#8217;ll give March over entirely to guest posts and never do it again. Who knows? Maybe we won&#8217;t get much of a response and we&#8217;ll forget this post ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>Topics for discussion</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s up to you, just don&#8217;t get us into too much trouble.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s an area we don&#8217;t do a very good job of covering, or something you want to have a rant about (opinions are good) or maybe there&#8217;s something that you know that you want to share.</p>
<p>You may know of an undiscovered portion of Birmingham that deserves a mention, or want to feature some amazing local talent you&#8217;ve come across. Maybe there&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s not being addressed. Whatever you have to say, we&#8217;re open to ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>Text, video, photo &#8211; whatever suits you best.</p>
<p><strong>A note about self-promotion</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>This isn&#8217;t an opportunity for some free press, advertising space or link spam. If you want to promote yourself/your clients then by all means <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/about/advertise/">advertise with us</a> or <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/contact/">get in touch with us</a> in the usual way.</p>
<p><strong>How to get involved</strong></p>
<p>SimplyÂ <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDRWekpETWU5OFNXamFmdFlLTTN4MkE6MQ&amp;theme=0AX42CRMsmRFbUy00ODg0N2E0OC04ZjI0LTQyZDItOTQ4Ni1hMDNhZTRkNGI5NmY&amp;ifq">click this link and fill out this form</a>. At this stage we just want to know who you are and roughly what you&#8217;d like to talk about.</p>
