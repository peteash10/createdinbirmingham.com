				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, not that many in the grand scheme of things, but I&#8217;ve noticed a small but determined flurry of talk/lecture/discussion events coming through my RSS feeds in the past few days. These are they…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.d-log.info/">D&#8217;log</a> has flagged up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.biad.bcu.ac.uk/research/site/pages/bpargevent.php">A Series of Conversations</a> organised by the Birmingham Photography and Archive Research Group; and</li>
<li>Some <a href="http://www.barber.org.uk/coins/coincurr.html">events and lectures accompanying the Barber Institute&#8217;s Cityscapes exhibition</a>. The &#8216;adult events&#8217; listed on that page are either couched in heavily euphemistic terms or not actually smutty at all. I suspect the latter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, We Are Eastside bring news of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/2012/06/hooky-street-press-writing-talk-1-eastside-projects-4-july/">A writing talk from Dr Paul McDonald</a>, presented by <a href="http://www.hookystreetpress.com/">Hooky Street Press</a> and presumably the first in a series. This one&#8217;s about how classic theories of humour can be made relevant to writers; and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.weareeastside.com/2012/06/there-is-no-script-for-this-eastside-projects-27-june-6-30%E2%80%938pm/">There is no Script for This</a> &#8211; a chance for &#8220;students, recent graduates and emerging practitioners a chance to quiz people at different stages of their careers as they talk about highs, lows and pivotal moments during their first years out of art school&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also loads of things happening as part of the <a href="http://www.lovearchitecture.org/region.html?region=West%20Midlands">Love Architecture Festival</a> and it wouldn&#8217;t be outrageous to assume that the walking tours have some sort of talky aspect to them. Sticking strictly to the theme of this post, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lovearchitecture.org/event.html?event=29">a talk from LEGO&#8217;s Senior Design Manager this evening</a>.</p>
