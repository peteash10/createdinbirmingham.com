<p>Pokemon Go is a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game which has quickly become a global phenomenon. It has been downloaded by more than 100 million people worldwide and has been credited with popularising augmented reality gaming, as well as for promoting physical activity.</p>
<p>This event aims to gather cultural and community organisations together to discuss the benefit of games, and how we might use digital technology and offline elements of them to motivate people to collaborate and make change locally and globally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ampersandprojects.org/" target="_blank">Ampersand Projects</a>, a Birmingham based organisation are interested in how we can use games to explore and solve some of the world&#8217;s social problems. Their recent project &#8216;The Gamification Lab&#8217; at <a href="https://macbirmingham.co.uk/" target="_blank">mac Birmingham</a> linked up young participants with arts organisations to create gamified engagement campaigns and build skills.</p>
<p><em>Please note that this event is not a &#8216;how to&#8217; so we won&#8217;t be showing you how to use existing technology but is an opportunity to explore how the technology could be used in the future. No digital expertise needed.  Free event &#8211; pre-booking essential.</em></p>
<p>More info about the event on <a href="http://www.ampersandprojects.org/workshops/">Ampersand Projects&#8217; website here</a>.</p>
<h3>POKEMON GO HOME</h3>
<p><strong>The event is scheduled for Saturday 10th September 2016, and will be presented in partnership with <a href="http://www.stillwalking.org/" target="_blank">Still Walking Festival</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Bit late in the publicising of this one, but Tim Hodgson&#8217;s just achieved a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign:</p>
<p>Pokemon Go Home is a free post-Brexit vote Pokemon hunt aimed at promoting community cohesion in Birmingham, UK. Many businesses have used lure micropayments in mobile AR game Pokemon GO to entice visitors, this event uses the same premise to encourage the general public to visit a variety of minority and culturally specific organisations, societies and places of worship in a single day.</p>
<p>We will work with twenty minority venues in central Birmingham with adjacent Pokestops, from mosques to Polish cultural centres to Ethiopian cafes. We will pay for a full day&#8217;s worth of continuous lures at their venue to draw Pokemon towards the site, will help the organisations to create an open-door engagement offer for the day and will provide onsite volunteer staffing support at each venue.</p>
<p>All info is on their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/202129527/pokemon-go-home/description">kickstarter campaign here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Monday 11 January ­ – Monday 25 April 2016</strong></p>
<p><em>Recruitment Workshop ­Monday 11 January</em></p>
<p>Following the launch of successful projects #ShoutAboutBrum and Forge Magazine, the <a href="http://macbirmingham.co.uk/project/next-generation/creative-agency/">Next Gen Creative Agency</a> are looking for young people to take part in an exciting new project  The Gamification Lab. The project is an opportunity to collaborate with Birmingham&#8217;s best creative and cultural organisations using &#8216;gamification&#8217; techniques to promote and communicate what they do. Project members will learn all about gamification and will create their own projects to motivate people to engage with new cultural experiences.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gamification is the concept of applying game mechanics and game design techniques to engage and motivate people to achieve different sorts of goals, anything from fitness to shopping. Gamification uses elements such as badges and point rewards, competition and leaderboards and collaboration with others. Gamification is currently being used by large companies such as Nike, who encourages users to lead more active lifestyles using the Nike+ application, and Starbucks allowing customers to collect gold stars via an app to gain special ‘perks’. Gamification has application across the work, education and health sectors ­ along with countless other real world applications ­without users necessarily realising they are ‘playing games.’</p></blockquote>
<p>This project will give participants the opportunity to test out new ideas and to work with some of Birmingham&#8217;s best arts organisations. Led by freelance cultural project manager and arts marketer <a href="http://www.kateandrews.me/">Kate Andrews</a> you will learn new skills in gamification theory, collaboration, teamwork, creative communications and project management. <strong>We are looking for 16 –­ 24yr olds with a passion for creativity to get involved, no technical knowledge is required.</strong></p>
<h3>Take Part</h3>
<p>If you are 16 ­– 24 and want to get involved with the project or find out more, fill in the <a href="http://macbirmingham.co.uk/event/creative-agency-the-gamification-lab/">application form available here</a> and come along to the open workshop at the mac on Monday 11th Jan 2016 at 6pm.</p>
<p>From there a group will be selected to take part in the programme, with meetings commencing weekly on Monday evenings until the end of April.</p>
<p><em>If you have any questions in the meantime please don’t hesitate to contact the Next Gen team by e­mail at <a href="mailto:next.gen@macbirmingham.co.uk">next.gen@macbirmingham.co.uk</a></em></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just in the city centre that exciting arts events are happening. This week in Yardley a school group will be promoting their local community centre in what could be the start of an interesting new arts/community space.</p>
<p>Children from <a href="http://www.oasisacademyhobmoor.org/">Oasis Academy Hobmoor</a> have joined with Coventry-based digital-dance company <a href="http://www.mercurialarts.co.uk/">Mercurial Arts</a> to create a new dance performance for their community. Working collaboratively since May, sixty Year 5 pupils have worked on the project, inspired by and exploring neuroscience.</p>
<p>As well as the dance performance, half of the children have been working on a ‘Digital Play Space’ to compliment the work featuring insights into the brain, interactive projections, film footage and sound using new technologies.</p>
<p>As a starting point, the children visited the University of Birmingham&#8217;s Medical School for in-depth investigations into the workings of the brain, and looked into complex questions such as, ‘Where do ideas and movements come from in the body?’</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17856" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3-610x405.jpg" alt="Ruqqayah and Laura at the University of Birmingham Medical School - Credit Toni Kerr 3" width="610" height="405" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3-610x405.jpg 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>Mercurial Arts’ Artistic Director Oliver Scott said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>One of the exciting things about this project is we can set the children complex and real challenges. Not only will they become a fully-fledged dance company making their own new work, they will share it with the general public. It is an ambitious task that develops physical, personal and social skills that will stand them in good stead in many contexts</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Chaotic Liquid Network </em></strong>is part of an exploration into the brain <strong>Mercurial Arts</strong> have been undertaking over the last year, and first investigated during their project <strong><em>The Seed</em></strong>, performed at the Coventry Mysteries festival in 2013.</p>

<p>The public performance of <strong><em>Chaotic Liquid Network</em> </strong>will take place at 11.45am this Friday (4 July) at Oasis Hobmoor Community Centre, Yardley. Capacity is limited. Book via the<a href="http://www.oasisacademyhobmoor.org/"> school</a>. The Digital Play Space will be open as a drop-in, from 11am-3pm on Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 July 2014.</p>

The Wall is already planned to host the work of <a href="http://www.briangriffin.co.uk/" target="_blank">Brian Griffin</a>, <a href="http://deanobrienphotography.com/" target="_blank">Dean O’Brien</a>, <a href="http://www.writtenbylight.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Jackson</a>, <a href="http://ikon-gallery.org/shop/catalogues/john-myers-middle-england/" target="_blank">John Myers</a>, <a href="http://www.lilywales.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lily Wales</a>, <a href="http://www.mahtabhussain.com/" target="_blank">Mahtab Hussain</a> and <a href="http://www.soniasphotography.com/" target="_blank">Sonia Audhali</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This first exhibition includes a range of individual works drawn from larger projects made by artists who hail from or are now based in Birmingham and the West Midlands. It also includes images from the nationally designated and internationally significant Library of Birmingham Photography Collection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This event not only brings attention to our photography archive at the <a href="http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/" target="_blank">Library of Birmingham</a> but it also brings attention to <a href="http://grainphotographyhub.co.uk/" target="_blank">Grain</a>. Grain are supported by the British Art Council and work with the library with a pure focus on digital media and photography. Their specific focus has been stated within their key objectives:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://grainphotographyhub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ec_portfolio_grain1.jpg" rel="lightbox[16841]"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://grainphotographyhub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ec_portfolio_grain1.jpg" width="235" height="158" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GRAIN: Key Objectives</p>
<ul>
<li>To identify and address the needs in the sector in the West Midlands region. To produce a range of interventions to develop and build upon existing strengths and activity in the region.</li>
<li>To build an ambitious and sustainable programme and infrastructure for photography in The West Midlands.</li>
<li>To create new collaborative and partnership approaches offering a wide range of regional, national and international opportunities to promote photographic excellence.</li>
<li>To build new relationships with the corporate sector to encourage collaboration, sponsorship, philanthropic and market facing initiatives.</li>
<li>To create new audiences and markets for fine art photography and photographers in the region.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only is <a href="http://grainphotographyhub.co.uk/portfolio-type/the-photographers-wall/" target="_blank">The Photographers&#8217; Wall</a> an opportunity to showcase photography work from our city but it also presents the opportunity for aspiring photographers to learn some useful information from where they can gain support and exposure. The Wall is free for everybody to see from Monday to Friday 8am–8pm, Saturday 9am–5pm and Sunday 11am–4pm. As a public art space and representation of our local photographers it should prove to be well worth a visit.</p>
