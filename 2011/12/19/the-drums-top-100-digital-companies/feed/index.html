		<description><![CDATA[One agenda is about trying to make commercial aspects of &#039;digital&#039; a viable employer to replace the loss of Rover et al. The other is about making sure that grannies can blog. Attempts to conflate these agendas have led to heated debates in the past, but personally I believe Birmingham focuses on one to the detriment of the other. 

Look at the NorthWest in the list you reference. The Northwest&#039;s five top 100 agencies are based in Manchester and Liverpool. Ours are based in Warwickshire and Sutton Coldfield. Why is that? And why are we punching well below the SouthWest as well as the SouthEast? We need a bit of commercial ambition in the city. I seem to remember someone saying as much a couple of years back: http://claritydigital.wordpress.com/2009/09/08/the-new-birmingham-city-council-site-a-step-back-for-the-citys-digital-ambitions/]]></description>
