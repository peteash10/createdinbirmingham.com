		<description><![CDATA[I was under the impression that the problems faced by the traditional media were structural (with consumers shifting to less lucrative forms of news consumption and the Internet chewing up classified/dating/property advertising) and cyclical (with advertising revenues being lower at the moment). If that&#039;s the problem, I&#039;m not sure what striking would achieve. Would the idea be to force the higher-ups into doing something more productive than just managing decline? If so, what are the chances that they&#039;d be forced to just throw the towel in instead?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As has been noted another 50 jobs are gone and the answers and strategy were sparse at the meeting It seemed to consist of everything that had been tried before, before and before, except for one thing..... going into every workplace instilling in  their members the required backbone and organising them to come out on mass strike 
but of course the leaders can&#039;t, for they are incapable of breaking the unjust labour laws by believing in mass action, and can only pin their hopes on just enough discontent to have the Labour party re-elected to bullshit and walk all over their members again]]></description>
