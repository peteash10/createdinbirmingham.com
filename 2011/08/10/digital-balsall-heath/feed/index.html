		<description><![CDATA[Ah. See, the funny thing is I didn&#039;t realise that was a mistake, but I&#039;ve just looked into this and now see what you mean.

I&#039;m slightly ashamed to say I didn&#039;t know what counted as Attwood Green and wondered if it was the name of an older area or one that included Balsall Heath. Although Ladywood did strike me as a little far out.

Glad it got sorted though. My local geography&#039;s certainly improved as a result and I&#039;ve updated the post with the right areas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for highlighting the mistake in the area shown on the website. This has, I hope, been corrected now. I understand MACE has had some involvement with another society project although not with this one.]]></description>
