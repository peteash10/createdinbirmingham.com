		<description><![CDATA[As the feature introduction explained, a popular response (and official council line I think) to Birmingham not winning the City of Culture 2013 title back in July 2010 was: 

&quot;We&#039;re a city of culture, whether we have a title or not&quot;.

The feature set out to prove this statement as accurate (though we all know it is anyway), via twenty or so vastly different creative or cultural highlights from June 2010 to June 2011 inclusive, as chosen by a selection of people working in the creative or cultural industries.

The feature (for the one-year anniversary of Radar) was never about celebrating Birmingham *not* winning the City of Culture 2013 title but about acknowledging and commending the hard work that goes into making the city a hub of creativity, whether Phil Redmond and gang decides to give us a shiny new name badge or not.

Hope that clears up any confusion as to how it all came about...]]></description>
