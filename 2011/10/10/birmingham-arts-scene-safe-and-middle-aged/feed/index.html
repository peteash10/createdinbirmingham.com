		<description><![CDATA[Spellchecker is a last resort for those, who don&#039;t have arguments and honest opinions. So it is generally advisable for open web-conversations  to leave as many mistakes in the text as possible without losing the idea; so those without arguments will be able to find spelling mistakes and that will make them very happy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand shear frustration of people like anon who get use to live in the permanent state of artapathy for decades and cannot tolerate any truth about such unprofessional state of Birmingham Art scene. And surely the only way out for them is to turn this discussion into a farce.
Birmingham is already 20 years behind London on art development.
Ignorance, apathy and bad attitude towards Art  like in the case of anon is very welcoming for artpolicymakers in Birmingham,-in that way they will be creating more smokescreen artinstallations just to cover up their luck of ideas, luck of creativity and luck of willingness to bring something more substantial than just Russian alcoholics to BMAG, antcurate to MAC or art-on-billboards. All those cheap ideas are turning ART into FARCE.
anon and the likes are afraid to demand more for their money.and voice their opinions and probably it wouldn&#039;t be very polite for me to change their state of permanent arthibernation. Probably I have to apologize even for trying!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This website has 1252 RSS subscribers and 4593 Twitter followers. And it looks like only Jo Plymouth wants to change the tragic situation in arts which engulfed the Birmingham thanks to the  pathetic art ideas  from people responsible for artfunds in West Midlands. 
Banton, -why don&#039;t you ask anon to show his artworks? At least you can see my thoughts on the problem. And why don&#039;t you ask Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery about Open Call?I just got the conformation that Herbert Museum in Coventry is planning one for 2012(information will be very soon on its website), but Birmingham museum and art Gallery don&#039;t, so It seems to me that you are asking wrong people wrong kind of questions. I would really LOVE to read your constructive comments or the subject matter we all came to discuss on this blog. 
Give Jo Plymouth the IKON budget,  and you will see  what he can do with it:
1.TWO ART FAIRS FOR LOCAL ARTISTS A YEAR IN BIRMINGHAM VICTORIA SQUARE
2. EACH MONTH WEEKLONG EXHIBITION OF NEW ARTWORKS FROM LOCAL ARTISTS
3. EACH ARTIST IN BIRMINGHAM  WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO EXHIBIT HIS BEST ARTWORKS AT IKON DURING A YEAR
4. I WILL ORGANIZE FOR BEST INDEPENDENT ARTISTS FROM BIRMINGHAM A STAND AT AFFORDABLE ART FAIR IN LONDON 
And if you would like any help in developing ARTS in Birmingham, I will be more than happy to assist you.
We are not discussing personal merits of Jo Plymouth, we are discussing ART IN BIRMINGHAM, or rather its absence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[anon, here is a link for you on how to present your opinions:
http://homeworktips.about.com/od/essaywriting/a/opinion.htm
If you study it carefully, maybe one day you will be able to present not just your naked emotions like kids often do to amuse themselves and others, but rather intelligent description of your thoughts about the problem other people trying to solve. If you have nothing to say on the subject matter, it is generally advisable to keep at least quite, and in that way you may look more intelligent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only answer I&#039;ve got from EastsideProject, CustardFactory, IKOn,MAC and some others is &quot;If you don&#039;t like it,-just go and live on Mars&quot;!
 We have several big things coming in ART calendar in Birmingham. One of them is http://www.ec-arts.com/2011/07/48-sheet-3/
It is an art exhibition on billboards, on 100 of them!! So lets think logically, shall we?
Birmingham doesn&#039;t have any art fair, doesn&#039;t have any independent art exhibition(apart from the small group exhibitions nobody knows about), but there are money for such cheap massive entertainment as showing art on billboards!! Imagine you are coming from the pub late at knight, and you have nicely lit billboards full of art everywhere;wouldn&#039;t it be nice to combine driving and art, waiting for a bus and art, talking on the phone and art, digging up the roads and admiring art? It is nice, isn&#039;t it??Or not exactly?
Obviously, you can make love to your boyfriend or a girlfriend on the Victoria Square, but that would be  rather the act of pornography, and not the real love, which requires solitude, nice lighting, no-rush attitude, clean and pleasant surroundings. So why we are forced to have pornographic act of deriving the weird please from the art on billboards  in Birmingham? I&#039;m sure those money would be much wiser to spend on bringing the  real art to hospitals and schools. Working artists are completely disconnected from young people, and nobody cares about it! 
Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong. Maybe I just have to go and live on Mars at the end....]]></description>
