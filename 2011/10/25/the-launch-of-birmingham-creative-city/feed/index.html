		<description><![CDATA[It was Timothy Huxtable (at about 2mins 20s in the audio above) who said &quot;Birmingham is already a centre of cultural excellence, with world renowned cultural companies from the large scale to small independents which are thriving, and I refer to companies like Stan&#039;s Cafe, Eastside Projects and Capsule&quot;.

I&#039;m not sure credit was being taken for those organisations - he did refer to them as independent (although query whether they&#039;ve affected the &#039;thriving&#039; part).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard Home Of Metal &#038; Supersonic Festival got named checked alongside Stans - for the record not a penny of BCC has gone on either projects. Great being a poster child for the city without getting any actual support - simple fact is that these amazing things will cease to take place in Birmingham in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt Murtagh
Please take it and make a show out of it! 
You may ask me why I&#039;m living in this graveyard under the name of BIRMINGHAM. I tell you why. It is empty, quite, no hordes of people are in the museum or in the gallery pretending they understand ART. No council support for welleducated but full of crap &quot;artists&quot;. When Birmingham council cut the support for arts I was disappointed first, but after the artscene cleared from all those pretentiousness and elitism, I told hem thank you! It will force artists to be more organized and more proactive and  go together. 
Artists in Birmingham have the golden opportunity to set up nice big gallery for themselves in the center of Birmingham,-in the next two years that opportunity will vanish, and they have to go to Jewellery quoter or something like that.
So anybody can  take another idea: get people together and set up nice gallery space near Victoria Square or in the Mailbox.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Think about this for a minute in silence: ALL ARTISTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM ANY IMPORTANT DECISIONS ON THE LIFE IN BIRMINGHAM. This is a 21-st century ,people!!
Council and Government officials are reflecting grim reality :Birmingham doesn&#039;t have any cravings for real art, or real creativity. For me Birmingham is a gutter for used artideas and second hand art shows. That is why most artinstallations in Birmingham are there  just to create smokescreen, but not substance, as mentioned already.
Big industry players in Birmingham don&#039;t have enough intellectual power to understand importance of ART.
BIAD  suppose to be a center of art movement in Birmingham, but in reality it is a just another place where second hand art-ideas continue their happy retirement.
UK, as any living organism, has parts  where ART is developed and consumed, and best pieces are stored(London, Edinburgh), places where ART is used (Brighton,Manchester, Oxford), places where ART is never goes to(name them yourself), and places where leftovers of ART ideas are dumped,-and this is Birmingham.  Simply put,-Birmingham-is a graveyard for used ART.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It sounds great and I would love to get excited about all this, but I have no faith it will ever happen. 

How many projects have we seen proposed for this area now? Remember the other Library of Birmingham that was going to be built there? (http://www.rsh-p.com/work/buildings/library_of_birmingham/design)

What about the BCU campus? And where&#039;s the vertical theme park going to go? 

I wish someone would make a bloody decision and stick with it. Is that really too much to ask?]]></description>
