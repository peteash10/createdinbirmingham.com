		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if the funded arts centre business model is centuries old James, but I see what you&#039;re getting at. I&#039;m a fan of mac, I learnt to play the steel drums there when I was a kid and I go to the cafe fairly regularly to moan about the service. [I think it&#039;s improved recently]. I&#039;m glad it&#039;s there, and I hope it is for a long time to come. I do think there&#039;s a danger that it could be a little too cosy in catering to the middle-class families of Moseley and Kings Heath, who arguably need a little less subsidising than others, but maybe that&#039;s just how it feels to me when I visit. Last time I was there it did strike me that there was probably a lot of commercial, creative potential locked up in that building and location and I did wonder if they were orientating towards that fast enough. Hence the comment. I agree there&#039;s a real difference between able to hire a desk and a real co-working environment. It may be that Moseley Exchange has already sewn up the local market, but I think the facilities and location of mac have huge potential. It does need an innovative subscription model, I&#039;ve seen plenty of facilities in London where they really make it work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately the 3rd Sector and Arts sectors seem to be like rabbits caught in the headlights of an oncoming car over funding cuts. I like many others are disappointed that public funding for the arts is being cut. But similar cost cutting is taking place everywhere, in both the private sector, as well as the public sector. 

Organisations like the Mac have been less hurt than others in the funding cuts. So bleating about it isn&#039;t going to do much good in my opinion. Perhaps it would be better if they, and others like them, could use the talents of the sector they operate in better? I think that they need to be more creative and innovative in designing and developing new business models that will help them to transition from a business model that is centuries old towards a new contemporary business model that will be sustainable in future. As Shakespeare once said &quot;whats done cannot be undone...&quot; so lets all move on? This is happening all over the world including in the Arts sector, so why not in Brum?

Jake, I agree that Mac has the potential to use coworking as a new revenue source. But I checked out what Mac offers and its very expensive hot desking, but thats about all. It became clear to me that the organisation doesn&#039;t understand coworking - either its philosophy or business model. Moseley Exchange (just up the road from Mac at Moseley crossroads) offers true coworking for creatives with a real sense of independence, collaboration and community. There are over 50 creatives businesses, independents and freelancers operating there. It is high quality and has a variety of membership options, and is part of the international coworking visa scheme that enables you to share an office space in pretty much every major city in the world....

As a Mac supporter I do hope this comment stimulates some positive thinking...

		<description><![CDATA[I went to mac the other day. I thought it had huge potential for one of those trendy coworking spaces. Car park. Actual park. Wifi. Cafe. Bar. Toilets. Just need some space, some desks, some power points and a charging structure. Wasn&#039;t there talk of a coworking space initially? I like to imagine using it in my imaginary alternative freelance career. How many subscribers at what rate would you need to generate the missing £100K? I&#039;d have thought this type of facility has a lot of relevance to the modern creative industries. Perhaps more so than traditional arts/crafts facilities.

I realise this misses the point of the letter above (or does it?).]]></description>
