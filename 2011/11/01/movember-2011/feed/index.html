		<description><![CDATA[Being female I can&#039;t really grow a tash as such. But I will be wearing heels for the whole of November in order to gain height (as I&#039;m only 5ft) and therefore I will grow a Tash..

My Grandad has just found out he has prostate cancer so it&#039;s a personal thing and it&#039;s good for people to be aware of such health risks.

Updates will be added to my Movember page on a daily basis.
Bring on the sore feet!]]></description>
