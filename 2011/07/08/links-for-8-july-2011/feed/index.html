		<description><![CDATA[Chris, Ian I&#039;ve noticed a bit of a dearth of comments on CiB lately and I wanted just to leave one to say - thanks for continuing to populate this blog with all sorts of stuff that I am just to lazy and go out and find out about myself.  I hope that you get feedback in real life about how it is valued but here&#039;s a quick &quot;thanks&quot; from me anyway.

As ever, I don&#039;t know how much of this I will get to see but I love knowing that CiB is there as a resource letting me know what I&#039;ve missed or am too tired to stay up for.

Keep it up!  If you want to!]]></description>
