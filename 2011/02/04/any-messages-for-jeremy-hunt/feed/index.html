		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d ask about assisting arts&#039;n&#039;culture people and orgs make the transition from a state funding culture to a sponsorship/patronage culture. It&#039;s not necessarily that people are unwilling - it&#039;s that this is often alien territory for them (just as the funding mindset is alien to people outside of that culture). Guidance on best practice and so on would be useful. 

I&#039;d also probably scream in his face incoherently about lack of mandate so it&#039;s probably for the best I&#039;m not there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dave - lovely, catch you later.

David -  Thanks for your thoughts. On a related note, last I heard companies from the West Mids were doing spectacularly badly at bothering to pitch for Olympics-related contracts. Not sure transport is quite his remit though (although there should be joined-up thinking across dept and all that).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d ask him if he would like to lend his support for the English animation industry through extending the Film industry tax break system to the production of animation.

Local animation companies have been missing out on large productions due to England lacking the incentives offered in almost every other nation with an animation industry.

		<description><![CDATA[I would like some assurance as to what benefit the Midlands is getting from the Olympics. We put in a strong bid, but inevitably we were dwarfed by London. I&#039;d like to see some more investment in the Midlands, especially in sports and so forth, seeing as Manchester and Glasgow have had Commonwealth Games money, London&#039;s had the Olympics and so on.

And as the High Speed Rail will make Birmingham International so much closer to the centre of London, will there be investment in that to match?]]></description>
