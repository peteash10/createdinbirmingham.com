		<description><![CDATA[Robert, I&#039;m glad you see the link with Sasek. I have to point it out to people. 

I was inspired to draw THIS IS BIRMINGHAM by discovering Sasek&#039;s THIS IS NEW YORK in New York, and thought &quot;Birmingham needs a book like this about itself&quot;...  I never planned to write a book about the Lunar Society, nor to do it in rhyme. The book wrote itself. I tried to give it a Sasek feel, but apart from getting the eyes to look like his in some places, I don&#039;t think it looks nearly as much like Sasek as I originally imagined.

The new edition is published in August BTW...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always had mixed feelings about Bowman&#039;s book. While it&#039;s a lovely thing in itself I&#039;m disturbed by how much it owes to Miroslav Sasek&#039;s wonderful series, yet (at least in the edition I looked at) doesn&#039;t credit or even namecheck the originals. Am I alone in seeing the huge debt owed?]]></description>
