		<description><![CDATA[A really useful and inspiring article, thank you. I&#039;m always complaining that there&#039;s not that much going on but clearly I should get off my ass and look a little harder. I take your point about prejudice about contemporary classical music too. Maybe too often I complacently think that contemporary music is to classical what &#039;installation art&#039; is to sculpture. I will endeavour to challenge some of my prejudices and check out some of your recommendations. Thank you.
