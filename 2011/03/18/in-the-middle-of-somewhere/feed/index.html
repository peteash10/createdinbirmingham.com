		<description><![CDATA[Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, and I may well be, but is this article essentially suggesting that a good reason to live in Birmingham is that you can get to other places? Which is not individual to Birmingham, most cities are an hour away from a long list of interesting art galleries aren&#039;t they? Although there are lots of great cultural happenings in Birmingham, it&#039;s a shame the city doesn&#039;t do more to make itself a destination, not a junction!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But what about Eastside Projects, Grand Union and Vivid? All these spaces are on your doorstep and &#039;spoil you with international scope and creative use of venues&#039; too. Ikon is great - but it&#039;s not alone in the city any more.]]></description>

You could also consider the Nottingham Contemporary.
