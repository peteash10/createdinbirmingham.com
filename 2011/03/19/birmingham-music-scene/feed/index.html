		<description><![CDATA[@Dave: from the point of view of someone involved with the negotiations the Musicians&#039; Union were having, the previous government were also talking about small venue exemptions.  This latest comment from the coalition is more of the same hot air to placate elements within the music industry.  If it is a case of watch this space, then I&#039;ve been watching it for 8 years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just noticed there was a section in the government&#039;s &#039;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.hm-treasury.gov.uk/2011budget_growth.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plan For Growth&lt;/a&gt;&#039; document (PDF - published on 23rd March) about live music:

&quot;The Government will reduce the licensing burdens for live music, which will include small music venues. The requirements of the Licensing Act 2003 are unduly restrictive and burdensome in respect of some live music, with evidence that small venues in particular are deterred from putting on small live music events. The Government will take action through legislation to reduce the licensing burden for live music performance.&quot; - page 101]]></description>
