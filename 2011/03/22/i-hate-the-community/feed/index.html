		<description><![CDATA[Hello, my name is Danny Smith and I did indeed write the, in parts I agree, incoherent diatribe above and I suppose I owe it too a few people to clarify my views somewhat.

The main thing I hate, if I hate anything, is the word itself, community. In fact the title, was supposed to be &#039;The &#039;C&#039; Word&#039; although, thinking about it, that probably wouldn&#039;t have shifted the focus. That word is used to hide a lot of terrible ideas, flawed funding streams, and shifts of responsibility to the groups of people councils should be helping (see. Big Society).

*Of course* I&#039;m not against networks of people that support and interact with each other. I do think its a bad idea to try and force these networks or presume they exist instead of actually seeking out and helping the ones that already exist.

I do, however, think a lot of community art is rubbish, but that&#039;s fine because I think a lot of other established &#039;mainstream&#039; art is also rubbish. Making the distinction   between the two is actually patronising to the former. 

To be honest the post was more of a writing exercise, I wanted to hit a certain tone, a style that I sometimes flirt with. I sent it to Chris and Ian honestly thinking that it wouldn&#039;t get posted and if it did it would make a change from the very neutral, balanced pieces the call for submissions would almost certainly attract.

I am not however trying to retract anything I wrote or even apologise for it, merely clarify.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree entirely with the bits that mades sense - not much of it unfortunately -  can you try and write something whilst sober occassionally, Danny?  Probably not.  Anyway, art done with people doesn&#039;t have to be dumbed down or reduced in production values - people ain&#039;t stupid, though often a change of language and approach has to be considered.  But polarised and reductive &#039;arguments&#039; like in Danny&#039;s post are always welcome to kick off debate.  Makes a change for those of us out here working in the real world not to be ignored.  I fucking hate the community,too, but I love people!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love &#039;community&#039;, even if word is a bit tired and been used to cover a load of not so very community stuff.  Ten years ago I wrote a fair bit about Community Art, Art therapy, Public Art, precisely because I didn&#039;t want to be some arse admiring my own naval, selling meaningless dross to rich folk.  I guess there&#039;s a fair bit between the extremes of &#039;community&#039; art and &#039;high&#039; art, but if it&#039;s a straight choice, take me to the bingo.

It&#039;s true, I feel more at home in an old community centre than an elitist institution of &#039;high&#039; art.  I guess whatever art you dig is fine, but community art isn&#039;t about art by committee - It&#039;s about discussing issues (using art) with people beyond your bedroom window.   I agree, mostly it hangs around for longer than it should, and is probably meaningless to you (and anyone else who didn&#039;t make it).  But that&#039;s because you&#039;re too old to be playing table tennis at the youth club.  You, your gang/unit/community/ group probably has no problems finding a wall to draw on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha ha ha! Mockney thuggery;) But you&#039;re right Chris - be great to map the wordology. For instance, compare the straight-talking way the Arts Council spoke in 1966; the year I was born:

“The major purpose for which we must use our money is to cultivate new audiences for the arts; it must not be done by means of a confidence trick... It is very necessary, if we are to be a civilised and cultivated nation, that we teach people the worthwhile things in life” (Lord Goodman, chair, Annual Report of 1966)

and here&#039;s today&#039;s quangospeak:
&quot;We’ve worked with our funded organisations to introduce new ways to measure
how effective we are at working together as a sector, leading to the recruitment of 150 artistic assessors and a new self-evaluation framework for arts organisations.&quot; (Alan Davey, Chief Exec, Annual Review 2010)

Perhaps Danny could write next year&#039;s report? - I&#039;m up for proofreading :)]]></description>
