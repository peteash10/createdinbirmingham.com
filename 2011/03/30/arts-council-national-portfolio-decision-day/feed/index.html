		<description><![CDATA[Rob - Audiences Central are an interesting case. They&#039;re one of a network of regional orgs that work on audience development, all of which have had their funding taken away. Their job has been to help increase the number of  audiences/participants in the arts generally - from what I&#039;m aware, they do that partly through training sessions to help orgs to market themselves better, partly through selling access to contact databases (for mailshots, etc). AC have done a few public-facing projects (and get further ACE funding for those) - The Big Picture in 2008 was one, and recently they&#039;ve been doing a lot over in the Black Country. They also run Scene Central (event listings) and a decent arts jobs service.

There are a few reasons why their funding might have been taken away though, irrespective of whether or not they put in a strong application - organisations that don&#039;t have an artistic output were earmarked for cuts by this government quite early on. Also, I think there&#039;s a feeling that there should be a competitive market for these kinds of services - that&#039;s the rationale used for ending Arts &amp; Business&#039; funding, even though the provision of both services (audience dev and private investment) are generally seen to be very important.

As well as getting money directly from ACE, AC get membership fees from (many ACE-funded) arts organisations and they charge for various services, like training and access to their big database of people interested in the arts (for mailshots and things like that). I was interested to see that AC were getting about 3-4 times the funding that the other audience dev orgs were getting.

It&#039;s not really my place to speculate, (but...) but the membership fees, occasional project funding and the additional paid services they provide might be enough to keep them going. From what I&#039;ve been reading today, their Yorkshire equivalent, called &amp;Co, apparently have a decent print business to fall back on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris - lack of clarity is an issue for sure. I&#039;d never heard of Audiences Central until this afternoon. I spent a few minutes on their website and I&#039;m still not sure what they do or what we&#039;ve been paying for. Are they a pressure group for people who like to sit in the middle of theatres?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kate - oh yeah. I shall choose to be flattered, rather than narked.

Ruth - thanks, that&#039;s probably not clear to most (I forget things like that sometimes)

Actually, a couple of people have pointed out that in some cases the bare list doesn&#039;t do a great job of the actual position - for instance, Birmingham Jazz will benefit from the Perfomances Birmingham funding, Shindig are covered by Live &amp; Local and Bilston Craft Gallery are covered by Wolves Arts &amp; Museums Service.]]></description>
