		<description><![CDATA[Hi Marcus, thanks for your comment, and thanks to CIB for publishing this article.
Your point about encouraging young people without a family history&#039;s in the &#039;professional&#039; industries to get involved in the creative education system and industry makes sense.
There are some good organisations helping promote opportunities and skills that could be developed. When I helped with built environment workshops that MADE put on at the Creative Careers Festival earlier this year, what was positive was the mix and variety of schools and young people visiting and asking about how to get into architecture and design.  To me these sorts of events are invaluable.
I&#039;d also say that art gallery and museum activities need to attract diverse and varied participants; to both their educational and family events, but also their fundraising and friends&#039; activities.  
These are the vital tenets of a young person&#039;s understanding of art, design and creativity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HI Laura,  liked your article.  I think you are emphasising that what is far more important than qualifications, further training, skills or even quality of work is networking.  It&#039;s not what you know, or what you can do, it&#039;s who you know.  In a contracting market.  It&#039;s always been said that in the public sector lack of market forces means lack of value for money.  But looking at private sector there are also no shortage of examples of average businesses thriving, or good ones failing down to who they know rather than what they do. I guess this is even more important, and slightly depressing for new professionals.

Volunteering and other creative approaches to getting yourself noticed by the people who may employ you is becoming more important.  I believe this make it harder for young people whose parents are not, or do not have professional friends, can&#039;t support them through further education, or can&#039;t support them to take risks like setting up your own business.

Can we, how can we, (or should we be trying to) attract young people from all backgrounds into creative careers in Birmingham?]]></description>
