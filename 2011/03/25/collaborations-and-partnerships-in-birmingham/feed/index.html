		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Simon&#039;s sentiments about Birmingham being a welcoming &#039;Open&#039; city not just to creatives but to business people too.

I recently attended the Ronnie Bowker memorial service at Symphony Hall, which was a great tribute to a much-lamented &#039;adopted Brummie&#039; with Ronnie coming to Birmingham in the early 1990&#039;s from Cape Town in South Africa as Managing Partner of Ernst and Young.

Ronnie felt that he received a similar warm welcome from a Birmingham that is always &#039;open for for business&#039; to outsiders, so much so that Ronnie immersed himself in the city&#039;s culture as well as its business community, becoming Chair of the CBSO, who performed for Ronnie at his memorial service so beautifully with Vaughan Williams&#039; &#039;The Lark Ascending&#039; being a particular highlight.

Ronnie&#039;s eclectic musical tastes led to another West Midland&#039;s institution Led Zeppelin&#039;s &#039;Stairway to Heaven&#039; being played during a slideshow showing scenes from Ronnie&#039;s full life. which I must admit brought a tear to my eye.

All Heavy Metal fans should get to The Public in West Bromwich this Saturday 26th March from 11am till 4pm for the &#039;Home of Metal&#039; Open Day which celebrates the West Midlands as the &#039;Home of Metal&#039; music, a genre bigger than hip-hop and rap, and created in Birmingham and the West Midlands in imitation of the heavy industry in the region in the late 1960&#039;s by pioneers such as Robert Plant, and John Bonham of Led Zeppelin and Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath, two of the greatest bands ever: &#039;Created in Birmingham&#039; (and The Black Country!)]]></description>
