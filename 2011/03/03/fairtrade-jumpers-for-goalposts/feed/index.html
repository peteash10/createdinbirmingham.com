		<description><![CDATA[Hi, sorry I thought first comment was suggesting no place for fairtrade in CiB.

As for effectiveness of fairtrade, I&#039;ve not had opportunity to visit Ghana and can only go on experiences of colleagues and what I read.  However poor conditions in fairtrade farms are, they do (I hope) meet certain standards - e.g. No child labour and no slavery, which exists outside fairtrade.

FAB wants to raise issues of injustice to challenge the status quo, to promote debate.  I don&#039;t think my ethics or morality is superior to anyone else&#039;s.  I only want people to think about what they are supporting by buying the goods they do.  Fair trade is only part of solution, but it&#039;s a start..

I don&#039;t understand where you have impression of fairtrade comes, but sounds like in overall objectives, we agree.

Could you outline how you think we can challenge status quo and make a difference to the lives of the poorest communities across the world?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t disappointed. You outlined your political position and I responded. That&#039;s called debate, it&#039;s a good thing and we need more of it. I don&#039;t believe that Fair Trade or anything else should be beyond criticism or scrutiny, just because the cause seems worthy.

I did some work for a London charity (www.worldbytes.org) a few years back that made a documentary about Fair Trade, and visited  Ghanian &#039;Fair Trade&#039; cocoa plantation. I was really shocked at what was deemed to be &#039;fair trade&#039; and I wouldn&#039;t want to condemn my worst enemy to the tough and back-breaking existence that people there have to endure all their working lives. In my view people should be angry and campaigning for people in such places to have the same standards as us in the west (or better). As far as I can see, the Fair Trade movement  is ultimately helping to keep the status quo by encouraging us to think that by buying the right products in our supermarkets, everything will be alright because workers in the developing world will receive the equivalent of a few more pennies. 

So no, I am not disappointed, I just believed in discussion and debate with a view to figuring out to solve the problems we face.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to disappoint, but hope other readers might enjoy.  CiB is about &#039;linking up Birmingham&#039;s Artistic and Creative Communities&#039;, many of which do consider moral and ethical issues through their work in Birmingham.  FAB work to bring together campaigners for fairer trade - check out the links in article to people (including me) who very much see themselves as part of Birmingham&#039;s Artistic and Creative Communities.

No harm in us westerners feeling good (we aim to please), to think about life and stuff (what art is) and all the better if through fairer and ethical trade we empower artistic and creative communities outside Brum to take contol of their own lives and flourish. Again, check out fairtrade website for examples of this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This looks far more like an appeal from a pressure group than something that I come to CiB to find out about. More importantly, The Fair Trade lobby is about making us Westerners feel good about ourselves than doing anything to lift subsistence farmers in the developing world out of dire poverty and endless backbreaking work. I&#039;ll certainly be avoiding Fair Trade Fortnight.]]></description>
