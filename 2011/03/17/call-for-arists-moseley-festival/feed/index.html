		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the 3rd year for the art trail event in the Moseley Festival but the festival itself has been around for more than 30 years. Every year it&#039;s bigger and better in different ways and the motto is the more the merrier.

This year there is also a call out for anyone who wants to volunteer to help with the festival website, the flagship Street Fair event, and PR for the festival.

Just contact the general festival email if interested http://www.moseleyfestival.org.uk/?page_id=15]]></description>
