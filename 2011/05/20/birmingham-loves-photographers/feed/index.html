		<description><![CDATA[Thanks mate.

I am looking to work with anyone who is interested - also, if you want to do something in conjunction with the blog to promote Birm &#039;togs then just give me a shout.

I am also launching a blog supporting illustrators &#038; graphic designers very soon. Same principle: promote, creativity, friendliness and, lastly but importantly, fun.

Drop me an email if you&#039;re interested in events or the blogs.

Thanks again for the support.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, I&#039;m behind this blog; how do?

Cheers for sharing our site on your blog. I am a barista at 6/8 Kafe, but doing this blog because I am a huge fan of photography and see little outlet for the talent around Birmingham.

We are &#039;threatening&#039; to do some events, first in 6/8 Kafe, including lectures, meet ups and other tom-foolery. Then into workshops around the city and further out.

Had a great response so far thanks to support from people like yourselves so thanks a lot.

Anyone should feel free to get in contact; I am open to working with people who wish to share talent and creativity. Just here for fun.

Thanks,
Craig]]></description>
