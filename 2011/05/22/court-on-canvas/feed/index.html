		<description><![CDATA[Tony is right, Barber Institute is underrated gem, you must go!

It&#039;s listed in new edition of THIS IS BIRMINGHAM out in July, as is the Pen Museum.

Someone should do a blog about all these places ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto on the Pen Museum and Soho House. Also RBSA, Aston Hall, CBSO Centre (for a concert, at least), Castle Fine Art Gallery (the commercial one at the ICC), Blue Orange Theatre (which is new, so fair enough) and any of the Michelin starred restaurants. I&#039;ve never been to Rush Hour Blues either. In fact, I&#039;m going to stop before this list gets too long.]]></description>

Old Rep
Soho House

		<description><![CDATA[Shame on you - it&#039;s a lovely serene place that gets a good number of visitors - but 95% of Brummies have no idea it&#039;s even there! 

They put on some super shows - the Kerouac was bizarre - with a single long reel of paper in a typewriter - which was the whole book!

Ann Sumner is a lovely lady - she&#039;s rtunning an evening launch for the Tennis on Thursday - contact her and come and take a peek!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shame on you Chris! It&#039;s not as stuffy as you think you know for instance last year they had an exhibition based on &#039;Beat Poet&#039; Jack Kerouac&#039;s &#039;On the Road&#039; which is not the usual sort of thing you think they would get involved with..

Last year I also went to a talk on the book by local historians Simon Inglis and Steve Beauchampe: &#039;Played in Birmingham&#039; which describes Birmingham&#039;s (and Edgbaston&#039;s) pivotal role in the game of Lawn Tennis, which is explained more clearly in &#039;Court on Canvas&#039;.

Did you know Birmingham had over 200 tennis clubs in Edwardian times? I grew up in a road in Bearwood which had a redundant tennis club: &#039;The Sandonian&#039; in it 

The Barber is variously described as: &#039;The best small gallery in Europe&#039; and one of Birmingham&#039;s &#039;hidden gems&#039; along with nearby &#039;Winterbourne&#039;, an &#039;Arts and Crafts&#039; house.

The newish director of the Barber is Professor Ann Sumner and she is not at all an academic &#039;bluestocking&#039; as you might expect and is a delightful ambassador for The Barber Institute and Birmingham.

I am sure if you contact her at a.b.sumner@bham.ac.uk she would show you round one of Birmingham&#039;s best &#039;creative spaces&#039;.

Best wishes
