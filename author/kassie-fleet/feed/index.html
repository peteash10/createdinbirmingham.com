<p>RoguePlay, founded in 2009, can most likely be found hanging from a trapeze, or silk, balancing, lifting or throwing one another, all while speaking a monologue, singing a song or playing the accordion.</p>
<p>Every year they like to showcase their new routines and skills from trapeze, to hoop solo and silks. With aerial acts, music and drinks the Aerialist Showcase tickets are charged at £5.00 with all proceeds going back into the theatre company with the aim of buying curtains for their new space.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in December we issued <a title="Big Hoot" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2014/12/08/big-hoot/" target="_blank">a call for artists</a> for the Wild at Heart project &#8220;The Big Hoot&#8221; where a unique collection of owl sculptures will create a trail across Birmingham this summer.</p>
<p>The deadline for submissions was early January and the Wild at Heart team received over 275 potential owl designs. Artists are gradually being confirmed for the project and most recently Stourbridge graffiti artist, Lee Woods has been commissioned to design an owl. Lee exploded into the world of graffiti and took on the persona Mac1 in the early 1990’s.</p>
<p>Lee has created a powerful, gritty inspired circular design on a 165cm tall owl statue and at the centre is an all-encompassing and incredibly powerful eye, something he describes as ‘<span class="il">the</span> corridor to knowledge’.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18622 size-large" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/WIA-_LAUNCH_IKON_030-610x388.jpg" alt="Picture © Daniel Graves Photography 2014." width="610" height="388" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/WIA-_LAUNCH_IKON_030-610x388.jpg 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/WIA-_LAUNCH_IKON_030-300x191.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/WIA-_LAUNCH_IKON_030-900x573.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>The Big Hoot is going to be a fantastic celebration of art and I’m thrilled to be a part of it. The coming together of artists across a breadth of different disciplines is really refreshing and will create a really exciting trail for the city. Lee</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find out more about the project <a href="http://thebighoot.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a> and we will keep you up to date when more artists are confirmed.</p>

They have strong links with Birmingham: creating a new piece in residence here after winning the Jury prize and the Audience prize at BE festival back in 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p><span lang="EN-US">Solfatara </span>is a geological term for vents in volcanic terrain that emit hot, sulphurous gases. The piece explores the idea that we are also full of these phenomena, orifices that allow our insides to come to the surface. A row over puff pastry causes a young couple’s frustrations to erupt with catastrophic honesty, as a masked figure dares them to voicing their true feelings. Performed in Spanish with English surtitles, the translation takes on a subversive life of its own.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://eyecandyfest.tumblr.com/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16338" alt="Eye Candy Festival" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-10-29-at-13.44.59-300x176.png" width="300" height="176" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-10-29-at-13.44.59-300x176.png 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-10-29-at-13.44.59.png 515w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The best thing about Eye Candy Festival is that it is all free and will be featuring work by a range of creative favourites such as <a title="JeremyV" href="http://jeremyville.com/" target="_blank">Jeremyville,</a> <a title="Kris Jones" href="http://www.kristian-jones.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kristian Jones</a> and <a title="MIss Led" href="http://www.missled.co.uk/">Miss Led</a>. I am most looking forward to the Vintage Mobile Cinema and hope to attend &#8216;<a title="Sign Painters" href="http://typetalksign.eventbrite.co.uk/" target="_blank">Sign Painters the movie</a>&#8216; on Friday evening as well as trying to find one of Kristian Jones <a title="Kristian Jones2" href="http://eyecandyfest.tumblr.com/Artists" target="_blank">15 limited edition pieces </a>of artwork that he will be leaving around Southside.</p>
<p>The full programme can be found <a title="Eye Candy Programme" href="http://issuu.com/fusedmagazine/docs/eye_candy_brochure?e=1038288/5322389" target="_blank">here</a> and the <a title="Eye Candy Website" href="http://eyecandyfest.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Eye Candy website</a> is continually updated with more news and exciting announcements about the weekend.</p>
<p>With the launch party happening tomorrow I caught up with <a title="Michelle" href="http://www.michelleturton.com/" target="_blank">Michelle Turton</a>, one of the contributors at this years Eye Candy Festival, to find out about her involvement.</p>
<p><span id="more-16280"></span></p>
<p>Michelle, who most recently featured in &#8216;1000 Portraits&#8217;, is one third of the trio of illustrators who are adorning Unity House with their work this year alongside Vicky Newman who is a freelance contemporary illustrator specialising in drawing, screen printing and generally getting her fingers inky and Louise Brangwin who enjoys using a mixture of traditional printmaking techniques and line drawings alongside digital tools. Their work shares a common theme which they thought would be perfect to adorn and decorate <a title="Unity House" href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Bromsgrove+Street,+Birmingham&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=52.472828,-1.895785&amp;spn=0.007764,0.012703&amp;sll=52.457997,-1.881323&amp;sspn=0.062133,0.101624&amp;oq=broms&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=Bromsgrove+St,+Birmingham,+United+Kingdom&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=52.473054,-1.896934&amp;panoid=JuyMsR2OclYqAeZpsR0MjA&amp;cbp=12,191.5,,0,8.49" target="_blank">Bromsgrove Street&#8217;s Unity House</a>.</p>
<p>Having been a part of last years Eye Candy Festival through her role in the <a title="Inkygoodness" href="http://inkygoodness.com/projects/sketch-brum/" target="_blank">Inkygoodness Sketch event at Le Truc</a>, Michelle knew that when Eye Candy Festival came around again that she would want to be involved.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eye Candy provides a great opportunity for local creatives to meet up and network as well as showcase their work alongside other industry heavyweights on both a local and national scale. Out of all the commissions available we were hoping for &#8216;Unity House&#8217;. It&#8217;s a beautiful building and to adorn it with a series of illustrations we felt would show it a bit of love, care and attention. Having researched the venue we decided to take inspiration from the buildings former usage and have produced a series of panels telling the story of the buildings varied past from the Victorian era through to the 1980&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>
