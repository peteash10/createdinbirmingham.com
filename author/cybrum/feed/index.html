				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.rbsa.org.uk/" target="_blank">Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA)</a> is hosting a Wikipedia Backstage Pass event on Sunday 4th November. We are all familiar with the concept of Wikipedia, the encyclopedia which can be edited by anybody. This ability for institutions to contribute to their own entries, the bredth and depth of topics covered, combined with the inclusion of media (pictures, video and sound) make the site a powerful tool and this event will explore how cultural institutions, in this case the gallery, can utilise this huge potential.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/RBSA_Backstage_Pass" title="RBSA Backstage Pass" target="_blank">Backstage Pass event</a> will see a small group (numbers are limited to 8 in this case) of gallery staff and both new and experiencied Wikipedians take a tour of the RBSA&#8217;s permanent collections and collaborate to add to and improve the gallerys Wikipedia entries. It will provide a crash course in editing Wikipedia and adding media content.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d be interested in attending please contact the gallery on 0121 236 4353</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A collaboration between <a href="http://ortcafe.co.uk/">Ort.</a> art and community cafe and the Disability Support Group, &#8220;Bodies&#8230; in Motion&#8221; is a project for women who consider themselves disabled.</p>
<p>8 workshops exploring body image and sexuality will culminate with a group exhibition at Ort. in Balsall Heath from the 19th September until the 2nd October. The project is only possible because of a successful crowdfunding campaign to cover the costs of the workshops. Although the target has just been reached there are still two days left to support the project at the <a href="http://wefund.com/project/bodies...-in-motion/p44393/">Wefund page</a>.</p>
