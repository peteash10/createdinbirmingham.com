				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/2014/04/22/three-up-and-coming-installation-sam-brookes/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/files/2014/04/three-Sam-Brookes-Part-A.jpg" width="370" height="520" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last Wednesday I was invited to visit &#8216;<a href="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/about/" target="_blank">Bryant Priest Newman Architects</a>&#8216;, located at 3 Mary Street in the Jewellery Quarter. Sleek and striking, the building has played host to a series of Birmingham based artists including; <a href="http://mrmoltonium.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Ed Wakefield</a>, <a href="http://www.janetudge.com/" target="_blank">Jane Tudge</a>, <a href="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/2014/01/24/three-contemporary-arts-exhibitions-void/" target="_blank">VOID Group Show</a>, <a href="http://www.stuartlayton.co.uk/" target="_blank">Stuart Layton</a>, <a href="http://www.sfbrookesillustration.com/" target="_blank">Sam Brookes</a> and will soon be expecting <a href="http://karenmclean.co.uk/" target="_blank">Karen McLean</a>. These artists were all selected to take part in a program set up by ‘<i><a href="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/about/three/" target="_blank">Three</a>’ , </i>generously funded by the Arts Council England, this flourishing 9 month project has provided a succession of wonderful exhibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sam Brookes is the fifth artist to take part in this exciting program and has been making use of <a href="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/about/three/" target="_blank"><i>Three</i></a>’s studio space having presented his exhibition, ‘<a href="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/2014/04/22/three-up-and-coming-installation-sam-brookes/" target="_blank">The Soft Machine</a>’ on the 24<sup>th</sup> of April, which will be running until the 9<sup>th</sup> of May. Having read about his intricate illustrations I was excited to see the complex figures up close. Peering around the corner of Caroline Street, BPN Architects’ large glass window glistened at me to come over and with the reference to Kafka’s ‘Metamorphosis’ already ringing in my mind I started wondering through ‘<a href="http://bryantpriestnewman.com/2014/04/22/three-up-and-coming-installation-sam-brookes/" target="_blank">The Soft Machine</a>’, looking forward to meeting and interviewing Sam Brookes.</p>

</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/threemaryst?fref=photo"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/t1.0-9/10172696_320691568055867_929146219858669056_n.jpg" width="442" height="332" /></a></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;How do you feel about the way you’ve exhibited your illustrations and that they are without a written narrative?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;I prefer it. I like the way that there is no narrative, but people can kind of build a narrative as they see it. Whatever I might have been thinking about at that time becomes totally different once it’s out of my control. It’s not in control of anything and the work is just at the whim of everyone else. Everyone has their own thing that they might see, think about or even just be interested in some part of it. It all might be similar to me or different, but I think that’s what is interesting really.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I struggled doing images with words. I found it difficult and in some ways it felt a bit stifling but I think it was probably a bit of anxiety whilst at Uni, working alongside deadlines, but it was good to do because it allowed me to develop technical skills and practice them a lot. Spending time in the library was also good because I got to read a lot of different books and I found a lot of influences there.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;So there’s a reading process behind it that is still important to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB -&#8220;Yeah, I don’t always read a whole book – I’ll read say bits and then that’ll work its way into the work. So with William Burroughs; with his bugs, centipedes and insects – things like that there is the imagery that comes up anyway. I don’t understand him too much because he’s very complex but you have to go with it, with ‘The Cut Up’ writings.&#8221; (The Cut Up trilogy consists of; ‘Soft Machine’, ‘The Ticket That Exploded’ and ‘The Nova Express’)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;But yeah, it influences it but it doesn&#8217;t take a huge control over the work. I don’t read something and really concentrate on a part of it; it just maybe vaguely influences it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sfbrookesillustration.com/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/824c90c95d39fc2bcf972dd25d14ae1e/tumblr_inline_n55e7cgoHf1r2gp0q.jpg" width="353" height="499" /></a></span></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;When did you first define what you do as illustration?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;I don’t know if it’s defined as illustration… because I did a degree in it I was taught in that certain way, so I was surrounded by it but I don’t know if they are strictly illustrations &#8211; they border it a bit. It’s hard to define. There’s an overlap of all practices; so graphic design, fine art, illustration and photography and then there’s middle grounds where they integrate. Its’ hard to really tell which one is which. The place where I studied was very renowned for children’s books and I just couldn&#8217;t do it – which was probably detrimental to me!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I couldn’t do children’s books because every time I tried to draw something, I ended up doing something that looked pretty gross! It was also difficult because there were so many opinions from a lot of people, as well as tutors and it was hard to decipher what to do with it… but I should have really followed my own intuitions because at times you get so anxious about what’s right or wrong you kind of forget that that doesn’t really matter. I didn’t like that part of illustration. With this work there’s no right or wrong way, it’s just what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sfbrookesillustration.com/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/d1a6a2eb54bffa69eb0c086bd7de8438/tumblr_inline_n55droO5Zt1r2gp0q.jpg" width="500" height="298" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;You said that a lot of the illustration that you saw at University was for children’s books. Were there any illustrators or books that opened you up a little or that you liked?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;When I was at Uni I was really obsessive with detail, I needed to loosen up&#8230; but once you become obsessed with something it’s hard to distance yourself. Then in first year, we went to visit a group in ‘Big Orange Studios’. We saw someone called Paul Davis and I really liked his way of working. I also like David Hughes, he has a crude and quite violent style of working. I liked his technique; it was very scratchy. They were caricatures done with pen and ink, very crude but they were also funny. Now really, I like Julie Mehretu. Her way of working is based upon mark making &#8211; the variation of marking and the way in which each mark feels. She does these huge abstract paintings. <i>She</i> calls them paintings, they’re kind of drawings and paintings &#8211; absolutely massive layered architectural drawings. She creates this chaotic atmosphere with the marks and it’s like the movement within a city or a space – but with marks made with ink and paint. She’s amazing and I really enjoy her work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I like lots of things that I see or read (such as) films and Polish Surrealist poster art. I’m interested more in now working with the figure and (gestures to the illustrations around us) how some of them are much more final, they look like creatures within themselves &#8211; I’m interested in the shapes of the body. Say you draw two overlapping figures, how the lines are crossed form new shapes and the space around the shape of the body is changed by directions. I start thinking about lots of different things at once.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/threemaryst"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://scontent-a-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/10260039_320691681389189_7334664961734174265_n.jpg" width="311" height="415" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;But you’re able to record it all?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>(He reaches over to his coat and produces one of his sketchbooks. Here I get a chance to see one of his works in progress. He gestures to more pronounced areas of the drawing whilst explaining how he felt towards the shapes on the page. The drawing appears to portray moving figures, showing a continued use of black ink markings, creating stark contrast and shading against the white of the paper)</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;This piece that I’ve been working on is going down this new route and process. So, finding bits that are more pronounced, taking some parts out and then forgetting them &#8211; seeing what these different shapes are doing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once they overlap like this it’s interesting to see how it obliterates it – the image completely changes after you’ve overlapped it. I want to use velum; it’s a type of tracing paper that you can see through better. You can get marks to overlap but still see through it. I want to find a way to develop a depth within the drawings, without just drawing straight over them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;There’s obviously a lot of movement in this piece but at the same time the image is also obviously very static. So you can already see the layers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;It’s like gestural drawing. That’s what’s kind of weird isn’t it? It seems like there’s movement but when in actual fact it’s such a static way of working. It’s very methodical and very time consuming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That does give it a ‘stillness’ but it also looks like there’s a bit of movement. That’s why I need to get these more gestural; quick, impulsive marks within the work. I’d like to make more use of the lines of red, as they affect the way that the eye scans across the work and use masculine/feminine lines too.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;Once up close to the pictures, you notice all the dots and the detail. Are the dots important to you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;It makes me sure that I’ve been working hard. I really need to get away from the dots. They give an interesting quality but they are punitive, they punish you. After a while they aren’t enjoyable. With that one (picture below) I enjoyed the viciousness of breaking the pens, the more uncaring marks. There are parts that I like and others that I don’t. Not the hand so much but I do like the legs or at least what’s left of them. There are parts that work, that are more developed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/threemaryst"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://scontent-a-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/l/t1.0-9/10297856_320691624722528_5136517734175373825_n.jpg" width="384" height="512" /></a></b><b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;Are there other mediums and materials you’d like to use with future series?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;I’d like to use Indian ink, different colours of ink like red with black. That’d be nice. I’d like to use more colours but it’s just my fear of using them. I need to break my working patterns down and reassess what I’m doing. Not destroy them &#8211; that’s wrong. Bringing in other things to it, other depths to the work could maybe make it more interesting and give it a different movement/look.&#8221;</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;How did you first get involved with this particular exhibition?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;Through Charlie Levine (Curator) and Amy Kirkham (Project Assistant). They were great, really supportive and I obviously wouldn’t have been able to have done it without them. They gave me something to work at, to aim for. I knew Charlie on ‘<a href="http://blog.artfetch.com/meet-artist-sam-brookes/" target="_blank">Artfetch</a>’. She was very good at seeing my work from a different perspective. When you’re all consumed in it, you don’t know how to look at it anymore. It just happens and then you need… well I don’t know if you ‘need’ it but it’s interesting to have &#8211; a different opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I do it for my own means, I do what I want and do it for myself first. That’s how it should be. When I was doing illustrative stuff for other people &#8211; I was not very good at it! But now if I was to do something for someone it’d be different, I’m more confident. There’s no final point but you’ll know when it’s finished. There’s a time when you’ll know to stop, but I am still trying to find when that is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That’s a big problem, I’ll just mess and mess. So I just need to stop but that’s good &#8211; to take a break and then come back to it.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/d4614c96f43c58365f13b0e195ad0a13/tumblr_inline_n55ejvzNWJ1r2gp0q.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;Have you got any upcoming plans after your time at <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/threemaryst" target="_blank">T</a></i></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/threemaryst" target="_blank">hree</a>?&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;I’ve got a friend in London who I’d like to work with. We&#8217;ve always got on and it’d be interesting to see how the authorship of the work becomes less important and unrecognisable. It’s getting two different ways of thinking and two different kinds of marks to see the outcome of those. I’d also like to find a new studio space, a space with other people or at least a space where I can also see my work on the wall. Then I could become less attached to the work, in the sense that I’d like to have no sentimentally towards it at all. Once I’m doing it I’m very into it but once it’s gone it has its own kind of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no sensible way to work, it’s a bit chaotic at times.&#8221;<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;Out of curiosity, how was the opening night?&#8221;<i></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;There was a good turn out! Obviously friends and family but we had some really interesting people. They seemed really interested in the work and it was good to earwig on what they were saying. There was someone there who ran the MA at Margret Street and she had some really good questions. It’s a nice space. Especially to be able to see that building opposite us. It’s a really lovely building.&#8221;<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;Have you been to the Jewellery Quarter much previously?&#8221;<i></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been here before. I used to go around Moor Street and Digbeth but I really like it here. It’s really quiet and a lot of these older buildings have been taken advantage of and turned into something good. I also really like the little alleys – it’s not hip and there aren&#8217;t too many people. It’s a beautiful place especially on a day like this.&#8221;<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JD &#8211; &#8220;Would you want to advantage of any of the buildings?&#8221;<i></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SB &#8211; &#8220;Getting a show in one of these buildings would be really interesting. I don’t know you’d be able to but I’d really like to try. Maybe that’s something that I’d do with others or maybe just myself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/threemaryst"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/t1.0-9/1004876_320691908055833_5476073726281846280_n.jpg" width="452" height="338" /></a></p>

Needless to say I really enjoyed my time at 3 Mary Street. &#8216;<i>Three&#8217;</i> has provided a great selection of artists and it’s been a great opportunity to appreciate the efforts of the people behind the project.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The 6<sup>th</sup> exhibition in the &#8216;<em>Three&#8217; </em>series entitled &#8216;Vernacular Capitalism&#8217; will present the work of <a href="http://karenmclean.co.uk/" target="_blank">Karen McLean</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">With all the build-up and enthusiasm for dance performances during <a title="Get Your Dancing Shoes – IDFB 2014" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2014/04/26/idfb-2014/" target="_blank">IDFB</a> I feel well and truly ready for BE Festival 2014. Having not personally attended <a title="The first BE Festival" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/08/the-first-be-festival/" target="_blank">BE Festival</a> before I was a little unsure of what to expect, and so took the opportunity to visit the 2014 launch at Birmingham Rep on the 16<sup>th</sup> April. I was quickly immersed into a world of acting, exciting workshops and performers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BE Festival has been hosted in Birmingham since 2010 after responding to an Arts Council-hosted conference entitled, ‘The Challenge of Change: How can we make a better future for theatre, here in the West Midlands?’ in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5 years on, the realised dream of BE Festival still continues. Having invited performers from 11 different countries to take part in this years’ amazing selection of 22 performances, the festival has already attracted a large following.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/93095334"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/teatro-sotterraneo.jpg" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year The Rep will open their doors to BE Festival, with the main stage itself set to feature a pop-up restaurant. There they will be serving delicious interval dinners to artists and audiences so that they can have an opportunity to eat together each evening. The menus include vegetarian options and advance bookings for this are now available through box-office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://befestival.org/festival/dinner-2014/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/restaurant.jpg" width="448" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ll now be able to see all of the wonderful events planned which include visual arts and talks, workshops, performances and even musical post-show events, finishing with an Awards Party on the 12th of July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even better, if you’d like a chance to be involved with BE Festival, meeting the performers and organisers behind the action then you might be interested in their <a href="http://befestival.org/get-involved/volunteers/" target="_blank">volunteering opportunities</a>. Open until the 12<sup>th</sup> of May, volunteering opportunities with BE Festival also include 6 positions for aspiring stage managers/technicians to form part of the Production Team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to volunteer please send an email detailing your interest, any relevant skills, experience and CV to emmahalsteadbe@gmail.com. Volunteers will be needed in May and then throughout June and July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the full 2014 programme please see <a href="http://befestival.org/festival/programme-2014/">HERE</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are all very excited to tell you about the return of the <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/idfb-2014" target="_blank">International Dance Festival Birmingham 2014</a>! You will be able to experience a range of performances from ballet to large non-choreographed social dances. With <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on" target="_blank">so many</a> brilliant performances to talk about, the following will just be a selection of my top picks for the festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-17529"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>For Starters, &#8216;Three Short Works&#8217; 24th &#8211; 26th April</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The International Dance Festival Birmingham 2014 kicks off with &#8216;Three Short Works&#8217;. From the Birmingham Royal Ballet, a selection of performances called Quatrain, Kin, Les Rendezvous and Façade. Les Rendezvous will be available to see from 24th–25th April, with Quatrain and Kin continuing to be shown alongside Façade on 26th April.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">QUATRAIN</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by the fantastically exciting and vibrant tango rhythms of Astor Piazzolla&#8217;s The Four Season&#8217;s of Buenos Aires, Company First Artist Kit Holder creates his third ballet for the Company. Following the success of his previous work, 9-5, which featured in IDFB 2012, these premiere performances of his latest work are keenly anticipated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">KIN.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An exciting new ballet from Royal Opera House Choreographic Affiliate, Sadler&#8217;s Wells New Wave Associate and former Birmingham Royal Ballet dancer, Alexander Whitley. The ballet, to music by young American composer Phil Kline, will receive its’ premiere at IDFB 2014. Not to be missed!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LES RENDEZVOUS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A huge hit when it was first performed in 1933, Les Rendezvous was the first ballet in which Ashton put aside the comedy for which he was known and concentrated on pure technique. Loosely based round a group of friends meeting up in a park, the ballet is a series of fiercely difficult divertissements which give the whole cast the chance to show off their virtuosity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FACADE</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, based on Edith Sitwell&#8217;s deliciously nonsensical poetry, Façade embraces the fun of it all with whole-hearted and wilful abandon. Be entertained by a series of delightful characters dancing tangos, foxtrots and waltzes, all with their tongues firmly in their cheeks. Choreographed in 1931, Façade was Sir Frederick Ashton&#8217;s first big hit, and is full of the gentle comedy he is known and loved for &#8211; an enjoyable break from the sanity of everyday life!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">World Premier, ‘Headphones’ 30th April – 4th May</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promising to provide us with a fresh organic series of performances, <a href="http://www.coreybakerdance.com/about/" target="_blank">Corey Baker</a> brings us ‘Headphones’. In keeping with Corey Bakers’ ethos of producing engaging and unique productions, ‘Headphones’ will allow the audience to direct part of the dancers’ choreography. Set to hide ‘undercover’, the performances will be surprising and unpredictable with elements of comedy.</p>
<p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEWFIx0EL4" target="_blank">this</a> trailer to get an idea of the fun performance, as well as directly suggest moves by tweeting @IDFB #headphones.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217; 14th–17th May</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.new-adventures.net/matthew_bourne" target="_blank">Mathew Bourne</a> has invited 24 young people to join his latest hit production <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies" target="_blank">&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217;</a> based on the classic novel written by William Goulding. There are 8 professional dancers within the cast, to work alongside the newly recruited dancers to give a unique opportunity to young dancers in each city that the production is set to perform in. Because of this the theatre performance has already gained great <a href="http://www.new-adventures.net/latest_news/bbc_breakfast_interview_on_lord_of_the_flies" target="_blank">publicity</a>. The combination of mentoring and unity has made the project a wonderful success already and should be a great motivational piece, especially for young people who with a passion for dance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.idfb.co.uk/images/made/images/remote/http_s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/idfb/IDFB_2014/LOTF_press_imagegallery_632_300_c1.jpg" width="506" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217; will be performed at The Birmingham Hippodrome over 4 days with tickets available <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies" target="_blank">now</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>&#8216;Spill: A Playground of Dance&#8217; – 25th May</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/08/11/dancexchange/" target="_blank">DanceXchange</a> is housed within <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/" target="_blank">Birmingham Hippodrome</a>, both of whom have worked together to produce the 2014 International Dance Festival Birmingham. Owning 3 dance studios and <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/default.asp?Id=77&amp;sC=page4" target="_blank">The Patrick Centre</a> (a 206 seat studio), DanceXchange strives to support the dancing community and enable their dancers to showcase the best of their talents. &#8216;Spill&#8217; was first shown in 2012, and is an outdoor production that will be performed in the beautiful Cannon Hill Park. Choreographed by Australian Artist Shaun Parker, of Shaun Parker &amp; Company, it should be a playful piece using street gymnastics and location based props of swings and roundabouts.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Born of a passion and a belief that opera can speak directly to all kinds of people, Artistic Director, Graham Vick, set out to create a company that the people of Birmingham &#8211; a city of many peoples &#8211; could be proud of…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">…We&#8217;ve got more exploring to do to discover where opera can be performed. How to perform it. How to re-write the rules of engagement between audiences and performer. How to experiment with space and acoustics. Who can we make it speak to?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/about-us" target="_blank">Birmingham Opera Company</a> would like to invite you to their production of <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/our-projects" target="_blank">Khovanskygate: A National Enquiry</a>.  You may have already heard a sneak preview at Springhill Tesco Superstore, where professional soloists Joseph Guyton and Stephanie Corley were accompanied by Sergey Rybin on piano. The singers performed a selection of opera favourites from Tosca, Madame Butterfly and Othello, demonstrating their talents whilst preparing to play the roles of Prince Andrei and Emma in this latest production.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The opera will take place in a big top tent at Cannon Hill Park, with performances at 7pm on the 22nd, 24th, 28th and 30th April before a final performance on the 2nd May.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story depicts Russia in the midst of a division between powerful conservative forces and growing Westernising influence. Musorgsky paints a devastating portrait of a nation on the brink of collapse; torn apart by state corruption, religious fanaticism, social inequality and ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unique setting and involvement from local performers already sets the bar for an interesting series of evenings. Birmingham Opera Company released an open call for singers with varied to little experience in performance, asking them to join in with rehearsals several days a week. If you&#8217;d like to become involved with Birmingham Opera Company&#8217;s projects yourself, then please contact them at <a href="mailto:getinvolved@birminghamopera.org.uk">getinvolved@birminghamopera.org.uk</a> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We wish the cast and Birmingham Opera Company the best of luck for the shows. For telephone booking information please call 0121 246 6632 Monday &#8211; Friday 9:00am-11:00am or use the following <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/" target="_blank">link</a> for further information and online booking.<i></i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://eastsideprojects.org/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://eastsideprojects.org/files/images/bill-drummond/under-spag-junc-web.jpg" width="560" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>From 15<sup>th</sup> March &#8211; 14<sup>th</sup> June 2014, <a href="http://eastsideprojects.org/" target="_blank">Eastside Projects</a> will be proudly exhibiting the work of <a href="http://www.penkilnburn.com/" target="_blank">Bill Drummond</a>, with a special preview evening starting from 6pm &#8211; 8pm tonight (14<sup>th</sup> March.)</p>
<p>The team at Eastside Projects have been working hard, preparing to host the first stage of Bill Drummond’s <a href="http://www.penkilnburn.com/news" target="_blank">World Tour (2014 – 2025)</a>, ‘The 25 Paintings’. Prior to tonight&#8217;s preview evening, Bill Drummond has made the voyage to Birmingham, arriving yesterday (13<sup>th</sup> March) via a <a href="http://www.penkilnburn.com/raft" target="_blank">raft</a> made from his own bed along the Grand Union Canal, beneath <a href="http://www.penkilnburn.com/paintings/5/25_paintings.php#spaghetti_junction_2013" target="_blank">Spaghetti Junction</a>. On this journey he brought with him four hundred and forty bunches of daffodils, and four hundred empty jam jars. Drummond will continue to live in Birmingham for 3 months before embarking onto the next stage of his journey.</p>
<p>Part of this journey will be detailed in &#8216;<a href="http://www.penkilnburn.com/sixty/#" target="_blank">The 60 Posters</a>&#8216;, an evolving selection drawn from the over 500 Penkiln Burn Posters which will also be on display during the exhibition.</p>
<p><span id="more-17234"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The central motif of the exhibition is the &#8217;25 Paintings&#8217; alluded to in the title, but Drummond describes his work as sculpture. The sculpture ‘The 25 paintings, begun in 2001, and will be complete on 28 April 2025 at the end of the &#8216;World Tour.&#8217;</p>
<p>The exhibition includes the &#8217;25 paintings&#8217;, &#8216;The 60 Posters&#8217;, &#8216;The 25 Sixty Second Films&#8217;, three publications – the exhibition catalogue &#8216;The 25 Paintings&#8217;, &#8216;MAN MAKES BED&#8217;, and &#8216;MAN SHINES SHOES&#8217; – and ten lectures, including three at Eastside Projects entitled &#8216;Art Versus Money&#8217;, &#8216;Painting Versus Sculpture&#8217; and &#8216;Life Versus Death&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>This large collection itself will only be a small representation of Bill Drummond’s extensive life-long investigation into the world around him, and it is at this point that I will mention how difficult it is to shortly summarise his career. Very short (62 words), short (288 words) and very long (10, 565 words) biographies can be found at <a href="http://www.penkilnburn.com/about/bio_2.php" target="_blank">penkilnburn.com</a>, detailing his work as a writer, musician, artist and just about everything else in between. The website is an excellent <a href="http://www.penkilnburn.com/about/poster.php" target="_blank">archive</a> of Bill Drummond’s work and I would recommend looking through it to get a sense of his work before visiting (<em>although it isn&#8217;t essential!</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://eastsideprojects.org/exhibitions/bill-drummond-the-25-paintings/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://eastsideprojects.org/files/images/bill-drummond/world-tour.jpg" width="254" height="384" /></a></p>
<p>Eastside Projects can be found in Digbeth, near the Custard Factory. They are open from Wednesday &#8211; Saturday between the hours of 12pm &#8211; 5pm. It&#8217;s free admission, and as well as the exhibition, there are a range of other talks and visiting artists that be seen <a href="http://eastsideprojects.org/events/current/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Today (14th February) sees the start of <a href="http://newartwestmidlands.org/" target="_blank">New Art West Midlands</a> 2014. It was announced in December that 24 emerging artists from our own regional universities would exhibit their work within four different galleries across Birmingham and Wolverhampton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.tpwestmidlands.org.uk/">A Turning Point West Midlands</a> initiative, New Art West Midlands exhibits the work of 24 artists, all of whom have graduated from one of the region’s undergraduate and postgraduate fine art degree courses in the past three years: Birmingham City University, Coventry University, Staffordshire University, University of Wolverhampton and University of Worcester.  Encompassing four nationally important galleries plus five universities, it is the largest partnership of its kind in England.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Who are the Artists?</h3>

The Barber Institute of Fine Arts owes its existence to the vision of Dame Martha Constance Hattie Barber (1869–1933). First opened by Queen Mary in 1939, the art deco building owes its design to architect Robert Atkinson (1833-1952) and has since been a home to major art collections, a public gallery and the original concert hall for the University of Birmingham. Their collection includes paintings by Old Masters including Botticelli, Rubens, Gainsborough and Turner, as well as Impressionist and other 19th and 20th-century masterpieces by Monet, Degas, Renoir and Magritte.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/">Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery</a> opened on 28th November 1885. Birmingham’s citizens had campaigned for a Corporation Art Gallery for over 40 years. The generosity of manufacturers such as Thomas Clarkson Osler, Richard and George Tangye, and Mayors Joseph and Richard Chamberlain, secured the art gallery for the town. Now funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and Birmingham City Council it now boasts over 500,000 objects to make up the numerous collections that originate from each of the continents and dating from 200,000 years ago to the modern day.</p>

Wolverhampton Art Gallery has a range of collections and regularly exhibits new works, including contemporary pieces as well as grand paintings dating back as far as the 18<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Not only is Wolverhampton Art Gallery a great resource for artworks, they are also involved with their community, regularly running events and workshops that are open to the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wolverhampton Art Gallery is open from Monday – Saturday between the hours of 10am – 5pm.

<p style="text-align: justify;">University of Birmingham has been pleased to welcome back <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/catalystpressorg/contact" target="_blank">Stewart Brown</a> to host his work once again in their <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/events/events/BABEL-An-exhibition-of-images-and-words-by-Stewart-Brown.aspx" target="_blank">Aston Webb Rotunda building</a>. The exhibition started in December and has been extended until 11th February. The work is on show from Monday to Friday between 9:00am till 5:00pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Stewart Brown’s first exhibition of BABEL was in 2007 at University of Birmingham. Having explored literature and visual art during his time working in various schools and Universities in Jamaica, Nigeria Wales and Barbados his practice is heavily based on his own questioning and interpretation of how we recycle and take in information around us. This playful final visual work is a representation of these two practices working together and merging to form ‘<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/catalystpressorg/works-list/the-babel-series/babel-volume-2" target="_blank">BABEL</a>’.</p>

<p>‘<a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/news?id=315" target="_blank">For the Record</a>’ looks to be a wonderful collection of female contemporary artists that have been carefully selected to take the audience through the development of artwork produced by women. It is curated by Lisa Beauchamp (Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery) and Rachel Bradley (Freelance Curator) who together brought forward this selection of artists, sufficiently teasing most of us with sneak peeks on <a href="https://twitter.com/BMAGcurators" target="_blank">twitte</a><a href="https://twitter.com/BMAGcurators" target="_blank">r</a>.</p>
<p>Lisa Beauchamp comments; “We are delighted to be able to showcase the work of some incredible female artists in this exhibition and to celebrate the reopening of the Waterhall Gallery. Incorporating works by artists such as Ana Maria Pacheco, Mary Kelly, Emmy Bridgwater, Alice Channer and Turner-prize nominee Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, we hope this exhibition will open up an interesting dialogue between these artists and showcase the strength and diversity of Birmingham’s collections alongside some stand-out loans from the Arts Council Collection. It is great for our visitors to be able to explore more of these amazing works.”</p>
<p>Hopefully with some of the names given there you have either noticed an artist that you’ve already wanted to see the work of or you will be able to find out a little bit more about them and what their work has achieved.</p>

<p>Alongside this exhibition will be the reveal of two West Midlands based female artists<a href="http://www.fayeclaridge.co.uk/introduction.html" target="_blank"> Faye Claridge</a> and<a href="http://www.barbarawalker.co.uk/" target="_blank"> Barbara Walker</a>. Barbara Walker’s practice includes drawing and painting, and has created a series of works called ‘<a href="http://www.barbarawalker.co.uk/index.php/project/show-and-tell/" target="_blank">Show and Tell</a>’ in which she draws portraits of young men and boys, focusing on key items of clothing that assert dominance and personality without having to depict their faces. This selective focus carries with it the significance that cultural symbolism can have by bringing about a certain image or atmosphere just by the depiction of certain types of clothes. What messages are chosen and which are incidental due to our learnt response?</p>
<p>Faye Claridge’s work is founded in digital media, and she creates a sense of ‘otherness’ and mythology <a href="http://www.fayeclaridge.co.uk/statement.html" target="_blank">that</a>;</p>
<p>“…Explores relational subjectivity and self-awareness through the awareness of ‘the other’ and &#8216;the past&#8217;. With an inability to focus on the ever-shifting present, I believe we instead try to explore our identities in relation to (the distance of) others, in relation to a (performed) role and in relation to the (imagined) past. As such, much of my work looks at personal and community identity through the re-interpretation of British tradition. My photographs reference museum tableau and grand portraiture and present subjects drawn from national customs and folklore.”</p>

<p>Their success and strong artwork deserves to hold a place next to the collection already selected, and will bring the history of female artists within contemporary art well and truly into the present day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/news?id=315" target="_blank">For the Record</a> opens today (27th January) and runs until the 29<sup>th</sup> of June.</p>
