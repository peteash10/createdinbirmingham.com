<p>The changes that the Balsall Heath neighbourhood have gone through are being explored by the local community and researchers from the University of Birmingham and Birmingham City University. Their <a href="http://culturalintermediation.wordpress.com/2014/05/27/balsall-heath-meeting-and-screening-all-welcome/" target="_blank">Cultural Intermediation</a> project is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council as part of its <a href="http://culturalintermediation.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">2012 &#8211; 2016 Connected Communities programme</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://culturalintermediation.wordpress.com/2014/05/27/balsall-heath-meeting-and-screening-all-welcome/" target="_blank">On Wednesday 4th June</a>, the group is inviting Balsall Heath residents to take part in the heritage project designed to promote local ownership of arts and culture.</p>
<p>The meeting will also host a long-lost gem from the BBC archives called <a href="http://www.pebblemill.org/blog/a-touch-of-eastern-promise-1973-tara-prem/" target="_blank">&#8216;A Touch of Eastern Promise&#8217;</a>. This is a 30-minute drama first broadcast in 1973 and produced at Pebble Mill studios. The light-hearted drama is about a young man (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756223/" target="_blank">Dev Sagoo</a>) who dreams about a Bollywood film star (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0557316/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1" target="_blank">Jamila Massey</a>) who he tries to meet when she pays a visit to Birmingham.</p>
<p>It was entirely shot in Balsall Heath amongst the local Asian community. Most of the actors were hired from the local area as well. You can read more about the film <a href="http://www.pebblemill.org/blog/a-touch-of-eastern-promise-1973-tara-prem/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This will be a really interesting event getting people involved in their local history. The first meeting takes place at <a href="http://www.zomato.com/birmingham/hillac-restaurant-balsall-heath" target="_blank">Hillac Restaurant</a>, 568-570 Moseley Road, Balsall Heath &#8211; on Wednesday at 6-8pm.</p>

<p>Birmingham has seen a massive turn around in fortunes since its post-industrial nadir of the 1980 / 90s. Design is becoming a massive feature of the way in which the city is trying to shake off its grimy image and become a 21st century metropolis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aerosolarabic.com/" target="_blank">Mohammed Ali</a> (not the boxer!) has been a major proponent of street art as a tool of transformation. He is a born-and-bred Brummy who has his own brand of &#8216;<a href="http://www.aerosolarabic.com/" target="_blank">Aerosol Arabic</a>&#8216; to add a dash of colour to the greys of Birmingham&#8217;s landscape. His politicised murals have caused <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwgateK6gaM" target="_blank">controversy over recent years</a>, but have undoubtedly left their impression on the communities that accommodate them.</p>
<p>He has also gained international acclaim following his <a href="http://www.aerosolarabic.com/portfolio/tedx-in-the-vatican-rome/" target="_blank">TEDx Talk in the Vatican City State</a> and installations in <a href="http://www.aerosolarabic.com/portfolio/the-dream-cube/" target="_blank">New York Melbourne, Casablanca and Dubai.</a></p>
<p>His talk is at Brainbox in the Library of Birmingham on Thursday at 5.30pm. He will present his work and ideas about how he believes bringing an alternative visual landscape to the cities we live in, is the way to deal with social ills and celebrating multi-cultural Britain.</p>
<p>He will also be talking about his work with the Library, access to resources and to Library’s expertise in the development of cultural engagement programmes, projects and activities.</p>
<p>Tickets for this event are £5 and are available via <a href="http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/event/Events/transformingthecity">The Box</a>.</p>

<p>You never need many excuses to see a film at <a href="https://www.theelectric.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Electric Cinema</a>. This is the oldest working cinema in the UK, it has the comfiest sofas you&#8217;ll ever sit in &#8211; and you can text the bar to bring you drinks and popcorn if you fancy paying for the privilege.</p>
<p>On Friday 25th April they will be screening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o87mygHCsu0" target="_blank">We Are The Freaks</a>, an ode to teen coming-of-age movies, the fall of Margaret Thatcher and mad nights out in 1990s Birmingham. The ensemble cast includes the stars of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0jkv2bRFgQ" target="_blank">This is England</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqkqF--v1tg" target="_blank">Kill List</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm0onseM1Mw" target="_blank">Skins</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XYLVs3le3w" target="_blank">Fresh Meat</a>.</p>
<p>The film premiered at last year&#8217;s Edinburgh Fringe Festival and received some excellent reviews. Birmingham-born director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0249210/" target="_blank">Justin Edgar</a> has filled it with energetic and irreverent humour. It does contain many piece-to-camera sequences and references to films of similar genres, but manages not to take itself too seriously.</p>
<p>The film will be followed by an open Q&amp;A session with cast and crew. Click <a href="http://www.theelectric.co.uk/programme.php?film=836" target="_blank">HERE</a> for tickets and more information.</p>

<p>What do you get when you mix a polemic topic, a misunderstood community, two of Britain&#8217;s best poetic voices and the artistic directors at Birmingham REP? The answer is <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/refugee-boy/" target="_blank">Refugee Boy</a> &#8211; a heartbreaking and hilarious production brimming with hope, humanity and love.</p>
<p>This is an adaption of <a href="http://benjaminzephaniah.com/" target="_blank">Benjamin Zepheniah&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Refugee-Boy-Benjamin-Zephaniah/dp/0747550867" target="_blank">novel of the same title</a>. It runs from Tuesday 8th &#8211; Saturday 12th April so order your ticket <a href="http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/refugee-boy/">here</a> before they get snapped up. It tells the story of Alem, a fourteen year old boy fleeing civil war with his family. After being smuggled into the UK, his Ethiopian father and Eritrean mother make the heartbreaking to decision to leave him in London whilst they return to their country.</p>
<p>Alem&#8217;s new life in London brings a host of challenges &#8211; he is shoved from pillar to post &#8211; between court hearings, children&#8217;s homes, and foster families. He decides to take control and become the master of his own destiny. He transcends his label and comes of age in circumstances too difficult for most of us to contemplate.</p>
<p>In this production, Gail McIntrye, Playhouse Associate Director, brings together the work of <a href="http://lemnsissay.com/" target="_blank">Lemn Sissay</a> and Brum&#8217;s favourite dub-poet, <a href="http://benjaminzephaniah.com/" target="_blank">Benjamin Zephaniah</a>.</p>
<p>The play has received rave reviews. Many of them focus on the production&#8217;s seamless transitions between stages of Alem&#8217;s life and the poignant presentation of such a tough young life. The creative team behind it were supported by a local charity working with refugees, <a href="http://www.cityofsanctuary.co.uk/birmingham" target="_blank">City of Sanctuary</a>.</p>
<p>There will be a free curtain-raiser performance before the evening performance of Refugee Boy on 10th April</p>
<p>&#8220;A Place Called Home&#8221; by Bethan Marlow and directed by Erin Gilley tells the powerful, moving, and inspirational stories collected from a diverse group of refugees and asylum seekers who are all in the process of making Birmingham their home.</p>
<p>This is one not to be missed. The best of Brum&#8217;s creative talent coming together and raising awareness of a serious issue.</p>

<p>This Friday 21st March marks <a href="http://www.worldstorytellingday.org/" target="_blank">World Storytelling Day</a>, a global celebration of oral storytelling on the Spring Equinox. This is the one day in the year where people are encouraged to tell and listen to as many stories in as many languages at as many places as possible. It is significant for its ability to forge links between creative communities and draw public attention to the role of storytelling as an art form.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Little-Miss-Creative/events/170679492/" target="_blank">Word Factory</a> event is a chance to explore how the way we use words impacts the way our view of the world. It will include a stellar line-up of female guest speakers:</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/Voiceofthepoets" target="_blank">Amerah Saleh aka Soul Poet</a> (she has been doing BIG things in this year with the indomitable <a href="http://www.beatfreeks.com/" target="_blank">Beatfreeks</a> collective and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXDT9IU0Uvs" target="_blank">TEDxBrum</a>)</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/article/younglaureate/ypl-laurenwilliams-profile" target="_blank">Lauren Williams</a>, Birmingham&#8217;s Young Poet Laureate, who at 15, is already making big waves on the local arts and culture scene</p>
<p>&#8211; Steff Thompson, CEO of <a href="http://rtentertains.tumblr.com/post/67685934132/steff-thompson-a-digital-media-entrepreneur-at" target="_blank">Rooftop Entertainment</a> and <a href="http://www.poeticessence.com/" target="_blank">Poetic Essence</a>, carving out her own creative landscape for Birmingham.</p>
<p>The evening is run by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Little-Miss-Creative/" target="_blank">Little Miss Creative</a>, a network of creatives uniting and empowering women in the West Midlands. Unfortunately for the lads, this is a ladies-only event &#8211; but for anyone keen on media, illustrating, photography, poetry, storytelling and events &#8211; this is one to follow for a taste of how Brum&#8217;s arts and culture scene will develop this year.</p>
