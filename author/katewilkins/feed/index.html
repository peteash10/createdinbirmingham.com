<p>The summer exhibition at <a title="Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery" href="http://www.bmag.org.uk/birmingham-museum" target="_blank">Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery</a> Gas Hall captures beautifully the story of inventor Rowland Emett.

<p>Emett&#8217;s creations are detailed and full of humour. The drawings are earnest and make you smile, and the machines are the illustrations brought to life as he imagined them.</p>
<p>Wait a few minutes in quiet wonder for each machine to spring into life and you will definitely leave smiling whatever your age.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.thebench504.com" target="_blank">The Bench 504</a>, owner Rob&#8217;s pursuit of quality graffiti, and the experience of travelling to paint, has led him to create a thriving business providing an exhibition space for a varied range of illustrators. It&#8217;s also enabled him to be involved in a range of projects, as well as protecting local graffiti spaces and introducing youngsters to the skill.</p>
<p>Now based in a <a href="http://www.custardfactory.co.uk" target="_blank">Custard Factory</a> Unit, Rob saw a gap in the market and put his savings into opening his own shop selling paints. Progressing from a few years based at a shared shop in Quinton, The Bench 504 now sits overlooking the pond at the Custard Factory, and has a colourful floor to ceiling selection of thousands of paints, which sell Europe-wide from the Birmingham location.</p>
<p>Graffiti artists take time to plan, practicing and sketching, often taking a sketch to the wall. Colour counts as part of the preparation. Getting good takes a lot of practice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1.jpg" rel="lightbox[17467]"><img class="size-full wp-image-17482 aligncenter" alt="Thebench504 exhibition weblarge" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1.jpg" width="467" height="640" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1.jpg 467w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Thebench504-exhibition-weblarge1-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></a></p>
<p>There are a steady stream of customers, as well as those coming to look at the latest exhibition. A customer arrives asking Rob for an order simply by naming the colour  &#8211; &#8220;I have learnt all the fruits in German and Spanish&#8221; Rob laughs, going on to explain that the main brands come from around Europe, and the range he stocks now includes seven brands as the demand grows. The paints stocked at The Bench 504 are highly specialised, some are even artisan &#8211; including Spanish brand MTM (Montana) being run by artists who couldn&#8217;t get the quality they wanted, so started mixing their own.</p>
<p>The exhibition space in the shop features a different illustrator every four weeks. Until Wednesday 23rd April the exhibition is &#8216;Off the Rails&#8217; by mixed media artist Lucy Danielle, a Birmingham-based freelance illustrator who studied at Birmingham City University.</p>
<p>Rob was also involved in the future of quality graffiti, ensuring it could continue in the local area. There was a park, Bournbrook Rec, in Selly Oak from the 1980s which councillors were happy to have as a legal space for artists, until mid 2000s when that changed. The local graffiti community gathered a focussed campaign and turned around the council&#8217;s opinion of the art, and of the artists, to overturn the decision and re-open the park.</p>
<p>The park is now back in full and frequent use with a high quality of work. The artists know what they can or can&#8217;t paint over, as the unwritten rules and etiquette of sharing the graffiti space are self regulated, ensuring they have somewhere to develop the skills and talent to create impressive work.</p>
<p>Rob&#8217;s enthusiasm for the art continues, and when the sun is shining the paints fly off the shelves.</p>

<p>Upon entering <a href="https://www.facebook.com/offkeytattoostudio" target="_blank">OFF KEY Studio</a>, you are not confronted with any skin. This place is about the drawings; the sketches, the design style, the colour rendering, examples of the artists’ work adorning the walls.</p>
<p>There’s an air of calm, with space to breathe and walls covered with inspiring examples of established tattoo artists. Forget intimidating &#8211; you could be forgiven for wanting to hang out there.</p>
<p>I learn from talking to Craig, the owner of OFF KEY Studio, all tattoos produced there are custom-made and designed by the tattooists. The evidence of designs; tracings ready to be copied, stencilled and inked, are a reassuring note that these are works awaiting a next canvas.</p>
<p><span id="more-17032"></span></p>
<p>OFF KEY was established in 2011, at first as a clothing line working alongside other brands, tattooists and designers. Craig, a local lad, set his mind to opening the Jewellery Quarter based studio, with his belief that the skills needed for tattooing, and the tattoos themselves, are the best form of art “you keep with you”. OFF KEY Studio followed in December 2012.</p>
<p>The studio is tucked between Birmingham City University School of Jewellery and an industrial tool shop. A subtle A-frame and hanging sign sit outside the red door. Head upstairs to a space where light floods in through the casement windows from both sides.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b.jpg" rel="lightbox[17032]"><img class="size-full wp-image-17088 aligncenter" alt="off key b" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b.jpg" width="430" height="640" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b.jpg 430w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-b-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></p>
<p>They produce mainly traditional tattoos with real artistic talent. Each of the two current resident tattooists &#8211; Max (explosions of intricate colour blocking, neo-traditional) and Rob (darker, detailed black work, without colour) &#8211; have a distinct style.</p>
<p>OFF KEY Studio is about art, respect, reputation. It is about dedication, commitment and finding that perfect (next) tattoo. With people often travelling miles to get a tattoo by an artist they respect, Craig thinks Birmingham is as good as anywhere location-wise, as it’s more about the person and reputation than the location. With guest artists on occasion coming to OFF KEY Studio, local people also get access to an artist who could be based anywhere in the country.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c.jpg" rel="lightbox[17032]"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17086" alt="off key c" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c-610x427.jpg" width="610" height="427" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c-610x427.jpg 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/off-key-c.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>Next step for the studio is finding the perfect third artist to complement the skills and styles of the current two residents. Reputation and quality paramount, Craig knows he has a challenge to find someone that can match current standards. Having been around the scene for many years, apprenticing, training, working, gaining licences and meeting the standards needed for the impeccable studio, there will need to be someone out there with the same level of dedication.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of collecting your next tattoo, have a look on Instagram at the styles of the two artists, get an idea of what you want, head along and talk it through.</span></p>
