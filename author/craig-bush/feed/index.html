<p align="JUSTIFY">Looking to develop Birmingham artists, Critical Spaces sets up local, critical support networks for socially-engaged artists, e.g. site-specific, situationist, public, community and outreach artists. These pilot groups are lead by artist <a href="http://www.hannahhull.co.uk/">Hannah Hull</a>, with the eventual hope that the groups will begin to run self organised meetings.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From <a href="http://criticalspaces.wordpress.com/">Critical Spaces</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;" align="JUSTIFY"><em> We find individual artists that want to discuss their work with like-minded people – and when we have located enough artists in one geographic area, we set up their first meeting.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;" align="JUSTIFY"><em>The programme for the first network meeting is curated by Critical Spaces in conversation with the local artists, and may include critical exercises such as:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;" align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong>Critiquing a work-in-progress </strong>– someone presents a social art project they are working on</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;" align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong>Discussing a short text</strong> – someone provides a current or historical text relating to social art practice to stimulate debate</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;" align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong>Debating a provocation</strong> – for example, “Artists cannot produce art in care settings until participants’ care needs are fully met”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;" align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong>A task or exercise</strong> – for example, demonstrating an exercise used with community groups and opening this up for critique, or an exercise designed to explore a key issue, such as evaluation</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;" align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong>Sharing experiences/advice on a key issue</strong> – everyone shares their experience of – or opinion on – an issue such as negotiating fees with commissioners, or policy changes</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After some rumours flying around, it has officially been announced that Birmingham&#8217;s <a href="http://www.artsfest.org.uk/">Artsfest</a> has been cancelled due to the council&#8217;s need for budget cuts. The yearly event was the largest free arts festival in the UK, working with arts communities and centres from across the city.</p>
<p>Councillor Ian Ward has stated in a <a href="http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2013/02/11/birmingham-artfest-scrapped-by-city-council-to-save-money-65233-32784824/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Birmingham Post article</a> that a new event would happen this year to replace the festival and celebrate the opening of the new library:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><em>&#8220;It has been decided to roll the arts festival into a festival for the opening of the new library on September 3 and I have spoken to the major arts organisations in Birmingham, and the Arts Council about putting together a new festival to provide a showcase for the best that Birmingham can offer.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>Apparently this new arts festival will bes starting from 2014, but will see the £130,000 budget for Artsfest going down to £80,000; although it has been suggested that the Arts Council may look to matching that bid if it goes forward. Maybe.</p>
<p>Artsfest has been a mixed bag over the past few years, but negative aspects aside, it is a shame for the city to lose such a large outlet for the arts and creatives, and also for for those visiting to see what Birmingham has to offer. Hopefully this will work out for the best and the new events that unfold will be an even better showcase for the city&#8217;s talents.</p>

Birmingham 2022 will have a strong digital media legacy with participants using a range of online social media to share their ideas.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>Birmingham 2022 aims to:<br />
&#8211; Provide a unique personal development opportunity for a group of young people from Birmingham<br />
&#8211; Develop both artistic and employment skills amongst the participants<br />
&#8211; Support careers development within the creative and cultural industries for a wider community of young people<br />

<p>Vivid Projects will be setting up shop on the February 22nd with a launch party in the space, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/459176447464108/?ref=22">check out the details on their Facebook event</a>, and also launching 33 Revolutions, with the first of their projects with Revolution 01, ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, How Long Will They Last?” starting at 7pm on their opening night.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few more details about 33 Revolutions lifted from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/VIVIDbham">Vivid Project&#8217;s Facebook</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The opening multi-media season 33 REVOLUTIONS will be a dynamic and sometimes challenging 8-month programme that asks the question; can art and culture be a catalyst for social change? Thought provoking encounters between new works and archive from 1960s to the present will addresses the ways in which film makers and artists from a diverse range of cultural situations and societies have protested. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>33 REVOLUTIONS takes the audience on a journey through film, print, performance and song, celebrating personal acts of protest and resistance from the dance floors of 70’s NYC to the anti-institutional spirit of 1960s &#8211; 70s Britain right up to the simmering Arab Spring and Occupy!. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, Happy New Year from all Team CiB!</p>
<p>Now that is out the way, let&#8217;s get back to the cool stuff happening in Birmingham.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/?attachment_id=14284" rel="attachment wp-att-14284"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-14284" alt="969953_orig" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/969953_orig.jpg" width="480" height="480" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/969953_orig.jpg 800w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/969953_orig-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/969953_orig-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>First off is an extremely exciting project <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/">Thrift Radiates Happiness</a>, a contemporary art exhibition happening in the often ignored Municipal Bank in Birmingham; the impressive yet slightly dishevelled building on the opposite side of Broad Street to the New Library.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/blog.html">TRH Blog</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>This exhibition presents works based on the British class system, the ever-present UK recession and investment in art and the world economy.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>With the main foyer space hosting a specifically commissioned sound piece by <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2013/01/artist-elly-clarke.html">Elly Clarke</a>, the offices off this central entrance will house pieces of work by <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2013/01/artist-tom-crawford.html">Tom Crawford</a>, Caitlin Griffiths, Ellie Harrison and Nicole Wilson, all of whom work with and present works based on commerce, current economical issues, up-cycling objects and investment.</em></p>
<p>This event will be opening <strong>13th March</strong> and <strong>close on the 17th of the same month</strong> and, although <strong>free to enter</strong>, there is a little twist should you care to make a deposit&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>For the second part of this exhibition audience members will be invited to &#8216;invest&#8217; £2 for which they will be given a number to a safety deposit box, within which will be a limited edition print by one of the contributing artists.  Their £2 investment immediately rising and resulting in an original piece of artwork made for the exhibition by artists and architects. </em></p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-riba.html">RIBA</a> event, curated by <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-trove.html">Charlie Levine / TROVE</a>, in association with <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-aedas-aedas-presents.html">Aedas Presents</a>, <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-birmingham-architects-association.html">Birmingham Architects Association</a> and <a href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-library-of-birmingham-lob.html">Birmingham City Council/Library of Birmingham</a>.</p>
