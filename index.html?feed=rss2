<p><a href="http://hfwas.co.uk/?p=3173"><em>Homegrown</em></a> is an ambitious artist development programme run by Birmingham live art agency Home For Waifs and Strays,  supported by Arts Council England and the Jerwood Charitable Trust. The aim of the programme is to showcase some of the great live art and performance talent in the West Midlands by giving emerging artists the chance to receive mentoring, develop new work and perform at venues across the UK.</p>
<p>After touring to some of the country’s premiere live art venues, <em>Homegrown </em>comes to <a href="http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/">Vivid Projects</a> for the final performance of the programme. On Friday, there will be a showcase of the work developed by the chosen artists over the last four months. The artists are an eclectic group, with practices comprising drag performance, performative baking, filmmaking, writing and theatre. One of the artists, Albert Smith, uses baking and bread making metaphors to explore his ideas and tell his stories. Another, Andy Howlett, is an artist and filmmaker who is exploring the possibilities of film as a live medium. Andy draws inspiration from the streets of Birmingham and is interested in the work of the Birmingham surrealists. China Dethcrash is a ‘swamp witch, performer and storyteller’, who invites audience members into her specially constructed dwelling for one-on-one performance.</p>
<p>Homegrown takes place from 7-10pm on Friday 9 September at Vivid Projects, Digbeth. Entry is free.</p>

<p>Pokemon Go is a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game which has quickly become a global phenomenon. It has been downloaded by more than 100 million people worldwide and has been credited with popularising augmented reality gaming, as well as for promoting physical activity.</p>
<p>This event aims to gather cultural and community organisations together to discuss the benefit of games, and how we might use digital technology and offline elements of them to motivate people to collaborate and make change locally and globally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ampersandprojects.org/" target="_blank">Ampersand Projects</a>, a Birmingham based organisation are interested in how we can use games to explore and solve some of the world&#8217;s social problems. Their recent project &#8216;The Gamification Lab&#8217; at <a href="https://macbirmingham.co.uk/" target="_blank">mac Birmingham</a> linked up young participants with arts organisations to create gamified engagement campaigns and build skills.</p>
<p><em>Please note that this event is not a &#8216;how to&#8217; so we won&#8217;t be showing you how to use existing technology but is an opportunity to explore how the technology could be used in the future. No digital expertise needed.  Free event &#8211; pre-booking essential.</em></p>
<p>More info about the event on <a href="http://www.ampersandprojects.org/workshops/">Ampersand Projects&#8217; website here</a>.</p>
<h3>POKEMON GO HOME</h3>
<p><strong>The event is scheduled for Saturday 10th September 2016, and will be presented in partnership with <a href="http://www.stillwalking.org/" target="_blank">Still Walking Festival</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Bit late in the publicising of this one, but Tim Hodgson&#8217;s just achieved a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign:</p>
<p>Pokemon Go Home is a free post-Brexit vote Pokemon hunt aimed at promoting community cohesion in Birmingham, UK. Many businesses have used lure micropayments in mobile AR game Pokemon GO to entice visitors, this event uses the same premise to encourage the general public to visit a variety of minority and culturally specific organisations, societies and places of worship in a single day.</p>
<p>We will work with twenty minority venues in central Birmingham with adjacent Pokestops, from mosques to Polish cultural centres to Ethiopian cafes. We will pay for a full day&#8217;s worth of continuous lures at their venue to draw Pokemon towards the site, will help the organisations to create an open-door engagement offer for the day and will provide onsite volunteer staffing support at each venue.</p>
<p>All info is on their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/202129527/pokemon-go-home/description">kickstarter campaign here</a>.</p>
