<p>We&#8217;re really excited to hear that Birmingham Architecture Festival is making a return this spring, after its successful first festival which was scattered across Birmingham last May. Excerpts from their PR email to us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The festival ethos stems from the notion that no matter how long we have been inhabitants of a certain place, there is always something new to discover. We are putting on a programme of events which are designed to &#8216;inspire the public, creative communities, construction professionals and architects alike to engage with the city in fun, inventive and thought-provoking ways.&#8217;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working together with Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and Barber Institute of Fine Art to put on some architecturally inspired family workshops. In addition to our range of tours, workshops and exhibitions, we will also be installing some public art around the city, some with the support of Colmore Business District. We will be announcing details nearer the time!</p>
<p>The festival is collaborating with a number of entities within Birmingham including Staying Cool, Barber Institute of Fine Art, Sara Preisler Gallery, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham Conservation Trust and many more. Not only are we enjoying collaborating with these great creative people, we also hope that making these links add strength to the festival.</p></blockquote>
<p>The festival will take place between Friday 23rd and Monday 26th May 2014.</p>

<p><a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/">Birmingham Architecture Festival</a> is happening this weekend &#8211; their launch party is in fact <a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/?page_id=1585">tonight</a>. Here is a small selection of CiB&#8217;s highlights/recommendations, but do be sure to read up on the <a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/">programme</a> yourself to see what other activities you could be getting up to this weekend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;-</p>
<p><a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/?page_id=1392">KINO 10</a> are showing <a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/?page_id=1392">a series of short films over the weekend at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery</a>. They&#8217;re all building related (of course) and feature shorts that explore Brutalist architecture, Urban explorers, the invasion of New York City by Space Invaders, MACE footage of Birmingham in the 1970s, and Billboard artists, amongst others.</p>
<p>On Saturday, KINO 10 are showing an exclusive intimate screening of &#8216;one of the best documentaries of the last decade&#8217;, <a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/?page_id=919">You&#8217;ve Been Trumped</a>, at 6/8 Kafé at 7.45pm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Funny, inspiring and heart-breaking, the film brings to light the appalling way Trump abused the residents of the estate, destroyed an ecosystem and broke promises he never intended to keep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">KINO 10 have some special events coming up over the next few months, so keep an eye out for them &#8211; you&#8217;ll probably hear first on their <a href="https://twitter.com/kino10tweet">twitter</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://stillwalking.org/">Still Walking</a> have a <a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/?page_id=1112">Material World Tour </a>on Monday at 3pm</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I went on two of Ben&#8217;s walks as part of <a href="flatpackfestival.org">Flatpack festival</a> and loved them both, and I absolutely recommend Still Walking events. Tickets are £5 &#8211; really good value.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every inch of the town and city around us has been designed, shaped and has a job to do. Material World examines the urban fabric of Birmingham to tell the story of the city, its natural resources and changing building methods, and provides a fascinating insight into the movement of valuable material around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Worth noting, <a href="http://stillwalking.org/">St</a><a href="http://stillwalking.org/">ill Walking are having a microfestival</a> the weekend after this one, Friday 31st May &#8211; 2nd June.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://baf2013.co.uk/?page_id=904">Pinhole Camera workshop</a> with <a href="http://photo-school.co.uk/">Matt &amp; Pete&#8217;s Photoschool</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>It runs from 9.30am 5.30pm and costs £40.00. For that you get to make a camera out of a shoebox and take 10 photos which we&#8217;ll develop on-site at the Old Joint Stock theatre by Birmingham Cathedral. The photos will then be exhibited at 6/8 Kafe on Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>You can win a place on this &#8211; they&#8217;ve had a cancellation and the person doesn&#8217;t want a refund, so they&#8217;re giving their ticket away.</em></p>
<p>To enter, email the answer to this question to <a href="mailto:info@photo-school.co.uk" target="_blank">info@photo-school.co.uk</a>  by 6pm today (Friday.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pinhole cameras derive from the Camera Obscura.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Where is the largest Camera Obscura in the world located?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Take a look at <a href="http://photo-school.co.uk/">Matt &amp; Pete&#8217;s Photoschool website </a>to see what other courses they run.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;-</p>
<p><em><strong>Whilst we&#8217;re here:</strong></em> THSH&#8217;s free interactive digital installation, <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/event/universe-of-sound-digital-installation/">Universe of Sound</a> &#8211; <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/event/universe-of-sound-digital-installation/">The Planets</a> starts this weekend at the Municipal Bank. They had their launch event last night (Thursday 23rd) and I&#8217;ve heard really good things about it. The team were invited along but none of us could make it &#8211; we&#8217;ll definitely be checking it out next week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2013/03/21/birmingham-architecture-festival/#sthash.h5Y8oZct.dpbs">we wrote about the Birmingham Architecture Festival</a> taking place across Birmingham in May. They have recently launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2011921337/birmingham-architecture-festival-24th-27th-may-201">kickstarter</a> to help fund their efforts, and at the time of writing they are half way to reaching their target of £1250.</p>
<p><i>“The Birmingham Architecture Festival is a welcome addition to Birmingham&#8217;s burgeoning independent festival scene and will hopefully do for architecture what Flatpack does for film, Fierce for performing arts and Supersonic for music &#8211; shake things up and get us to appreciate the structure of our city with fresh eyes.”</i></p>
<p><a href="http://ash10.com/">Pete Ashton</a> – <a href="http://photo-school.co.uk/">Matt and Pete’s Photo School</a></p>
<p><i>“Birmingham Architecture Festival has created a package of events to re-awaken Birmingham’s building users, and that’s everyone. BAF’s smart move is to show that architecture is not just about ‘building buildings’, rather it’s about how people live their lives.”</i></p>
<p>Ben Waddington – <a href="http://stillwalking.org/">Still Walking Festival</a></p>
<p>If you want this to happen and think it&#8217;s a good idea &#8211; make an investment.</p>
<p>You can read more about the BAF, including their aims of the festival, what to expect etc, on their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2011921337/birmingham-architecture-festival-24th-27th-may-201">kickstarter page</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Thursday 14th March saw the long awaited launch night of Thrift Radiates Happiness at the Municipal Bank in Birmingham. <a title="TRH_JAN" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2013/01/04/thrift-radiates-happiness/" target="_blank">We first talked about this back in January</a> but now it is here I wanted to give you a sneak peek of what&#8217;s going on inside in the hope that you pay a visit and &#8216;invest&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-14611" alt="TRH" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0128-1024x685.jpg" width="368" height="247" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0128-1024x685.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0128-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that such a beautiful building has stood empty for so long; watching people exploring and soaking up the atmosphere was really great. The main foyer hosts a specifically commissioned sound piece by <a title="Elly Clarke" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2013/01/artist-elly-clarke.html" target="_blank">Elly Clarke</a>. From here you can sit and listen to the audio which is a collection of interviews recorded with former employees of the bank. They give you an insight into the stories, history and personality of the bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-14612" alt="TRH_Foyer" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0143-1024x685.jpg" width="614" height="411" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0143-1024x685.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0143-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-14610"></span></p>
<p>The offices off the main foyer house four further pieces, all based on commerce, current economical issues, up-cycling objects and investment, by <a title="Tom Crawford" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2013/01/artist-tom-crawford.html" target="_blank">Tom Crawford</a>, <a title="Caitlin Griffiths" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2013/01/artist-caitlin-griffiths.html" target="_blank">Caitlin Griffiths</a>, <a title="Nicole Wilson" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2013/01/artist-nicole-wilson.html" target="_blank">Nicole Wilson</a> and <a title="Library" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-library-of-birmingham-lob.html" target="_blank">Library of Birmingham Archives</a>.</p>
<p>One of my favourite pieces of the exhibition was <a title="National Debt Project" href="http://www.nationaldebtproject.com/" target="_blank">The National Debt Project</a> by Nicole Wilson. Wilson finds at least one penny a day on the streets of America and since August 2009 has sent her found change via certified mail to the Bureau of the Public Debt. The exhibition is made up of a selection of her correspondences, all of which are copied to President Barack Obama, with pennys taped to them and a story of where she found her pennys that day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0137.jpg" rel="lightbox[14610]"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-14613" alt="TRH_Nicole Wilson" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0137-1024x685.jpg" width="614" height="411" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0137-1024x685.jpg 1024w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0137-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<p>Next to the offices is a small table with a stack of postcards asking visitors to draw or describe what they wish for the Municipal Bank. Some of the suggestions that caught my eye were an ice rink, a non commercial space for exhibitions, performances and events and also an Arts Bank of Birmingham.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14614" alt="TRH_I wish this was" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0139-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0139-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0139-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">What would you wish for the Municipal Bank?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The basement of the bank houses an installation by <a title="Ellie Harrison" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2013/01/artist-ellie-harrison.html" target="_blank">Ellie Harrison</a> titled History of the Financial Crises that re-enacts the history of the crises over the last century. The frenzied moments of crisis are relived, in chronological order, using popcorn and popcorn machines. Also down in the basement you will be asked if you would like to &#8216;invest&#8217; £2. This gives you a personal number that corresponds to a safety deposit box inside the vaults where you will find a limited exhibition print by one of the contributing artists. Being able to walk around the vault, look at the safety deposit boxes AND walk away with a limited exhibition print is well worth the £2 investment!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14620" alt="TRH_Deposit" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0158-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0158-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0158-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-14621" alt="TRH_ME" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0168-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0168-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0168-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The event is curated by <a title="TROVE" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-trove.html" target="_blank">Charlie Levine / TROVE</a> in associate with <a title="Aedas Presents" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-aedas-aedas-presents.html" target="_blank">Aedas Presents</a>, <a title="BAA" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-birmingham-architects-association.html" target="_blank">Birmingham Architects Association</a> and <a title="BCC/Library" href="http://www.thriftradiateshappiness.com/1/post/2012/12/partner-library-of-birmingham-lob.html" target="_blank">Birmingham City Council/Library of Birmingham</a>. It is open 12 &#8211; 5pm from Friday 15th March to Sunday 17th March and is free entry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The aims of Thrift Radiates Happiness are</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;to present high quality, accessible art in an amazing surrounding&#8230;to be a platform for future projects&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hope this is the first of many Thrift Radiates Happiness exhibitions.</p>
