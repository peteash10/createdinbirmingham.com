		<description><![CDATA[cheers for the mention Chris.
Just to clarify, that poster is a Waller Jeffs original from 1901 or thereabouts. Our publicity will no doubt be plundering some of his images and purple prose (eg, &#039;The Rage of Birmingham and Country&#039;) but will be slightly more informative. And the venue for the show is not Curzon St station but Birmingham Town Hall, a stone&#039;s throw from where Jeffs&#039; regular venue Curzon Hall once stood. 

By the way, near the back of this month&#039;s Little White Lies magazine you can find a writeup we did on Mr Jeffs. 

Here endeth the plug! Happy new year CiB.]]></description>
