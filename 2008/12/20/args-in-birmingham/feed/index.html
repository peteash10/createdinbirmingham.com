		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m definitely interested!!
Only just found out about these ARG things! They sound ace.
I been thinking about doing one myself.
Do people ever do this sort of thing in rented out mansions, castles or the like? 
Imagine how immersive it could be. Throw in a few actors for story/effect and you could make an ace game(s).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Ben - Glad to hear you had a positive experience with Emergent Game. Will be in touch via Twitter to get a contact email address for you...

@Antonio - of all the igs, iglab is probably closest to what we&#039;d start off with http://iglab.urbanantics.net/www/

There are a lot of people I&#039;ve spoken to recently who have started to become aware of ARGs and various playful things. To get to the stage where we can start making our own things happen I think we need to a) build a player base and b) build up our knowledge.

Initial ideas are to meet up to find out who&#039;s interested in what; exchange tales of the interesting things we&#039;re aware of/have been involved in; and then probably get the ball rolling by trying a few small-scale things. We&#039;re a bit late to the party, but Brum may yet get it&#039;s first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npugh.co.uk/blog/hideseek_2_the_lost_sport_of_olympia/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; labyrinth runners&lt;/a&gt;!

@Nicky - I&#039;ll be in touch!

@Pete - Hullo! S&#039;pose that makes the first meet late January sometime :)


That just leaves the question of finding a suitable venue...]]></description>

I&#039;m in!]]></description>
