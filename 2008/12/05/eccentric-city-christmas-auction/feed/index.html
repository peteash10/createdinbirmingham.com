		<description><![CDATA[We thank CIB for promoting the event. We welcome all new and old-comers to this event with optional dress code as you see fit. The pub, namely The Anchor, has once more contributed a guest beer in honour of the auction. It is named: Sunburned Santa and four pints can be won on the night if your lucky number is pulled from the raffle prize. Other than night, it can be purchased in the normal manner at the bar.

Thanks for giving us a plug and sending out cheeriness!

Yours warmly,

Harry.]]></description>
