		<description><![CDATA[From what I know 

RE:CatherineBray-
Its to be pretty much like a directory - hence you pretty much pay for a listing or space.Also likewise, there will be no reviews.

RE: Carson
&quot;editorial control&quot; 
Again its pretty much a directory so there&#039;s not a stringent control over what is included. Save&#039;s that same conversation over what is good and by what criteria - should there be a criteria - who makes the criteria and so forth.

Which leads me on to your next point - &quot;pedestal&quot; - I&#039;m sure anyone with a little foresight will want to avoid listing themselves as say an actor, with nothing to back it up. Pretty much a waste of their time and money.

Apologies for the rant! I thought I&#039;d do my best to dispel any misunderstanding of the concept here and other perfectly valid points that people have made.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree. 

Although I can&#039;t fault the concept of a showcase for exciting creative talent (as that&#039;s my job too) surely you need editorial control over who goes in the magazine to justify its tagline?

Otherwise anyone with enough cash can hoist themselves on a pedestal, regardless of whether they have any talent?

It&#039;s an interesting discussion to have, especially with advertising revenue declining - my question would be, why choose print rather than online, especially when you&#039;re first starting off building a brand from scratch?

Good luck with the project though, look forward to seeing the first edition and seeing if this approach pays off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm. Why would anyone want to read a magazine where they knew everyone featured had paid to be in it? 
It&#039;s like reading a book of adverts.

Can the artists featured buy good reviews too?

Or maybe I&#039;ve misunderstood the concept here...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;For money tho if Ive read it corretly&quot;

That is correct!

debut mag is an INDEPENDENT project - so any fee&#039;s are to cover production, distribution and other activities ( launch party-yes please!) that the guys at debut carry out to support and provide a showcase for new creative talent.


Furthermore, its a small price for those dedicated to their creative endeavour - you couldn&#039;t get a set of 5k flyers with that sort of money nowaday either - so its pretty much unbeatable value... 

FREELY DISTRIBUTED:Top quality magazine, targeted distribution, the added esteem of featuring and being published, displayed at local venues and selected retailers and so forth.]]></description>
