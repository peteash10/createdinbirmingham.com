		<description><![CDATA[Hi all - I am actually regularly blogging on the BB website at the moment - no copying and pasting, just a few musings from my own head about the events taking place across the festival and the significance of them.  

In my view blogging should be whatever you want it to be - a portal through which to convey information, opinions or just to spout off.  It doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be everything at once.  So I&#039;d say control c, control v when you&#039;ve got a business to run is better than nothing at all! 

Cheers,

James Bovill]]></description>
