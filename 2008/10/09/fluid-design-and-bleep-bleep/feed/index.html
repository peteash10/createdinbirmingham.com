		<description><![CDATA[Jonny&#039;s comment aside, I have to wonder why it&#039;s surprising to people that a Birmingham base shouldn&#039;t correlate to a Birmingham client list. For many the whole point of business is to move money from one country or region to another, not to shuffle it between the usual suspects within a city scene. The business that I worked in back in the early 90&#039;s did most of its work in Switzerland, and my own consultancy found a much more receptive and less conservative client base outside of Birmingham. Now much of my work is with colleagues in Asia, rather than the UK. Here&#039;s to miscegenation, rather than inbreeding!]]></description>
