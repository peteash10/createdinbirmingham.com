		<description><![CDATA[How are fringe/evening events to be provided and encouraged? Would they send a &#039;pay cash&#039; cheque to an individual to create a fringe activity? My point, what is fringe if it has a number of decision makers making recommendations to suit &#039;said&#039; agenda? Surely a contradiction here? I&#039;m all for fringe especially if they occur during the daytime including week days (entertainment not as you might expect, inside working hours!). No there&#039;s a thought. Let&#039;s break some rules!
