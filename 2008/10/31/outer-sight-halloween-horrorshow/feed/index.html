		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mr/Miss/Mrs/Ms B.

We tried to create a MutantCyborgFundingDroid in the top secret  OUTER SIGHT laboratory. It took one look around it,  with it&#039;s cold, metallic eyes and pulsing robo-lizard brain, and spectacularly self-destructed.

We scattered it&#039;s carbon-rich ashes over the skies above Eastside, hoping to unleash a wave of genetic mutation in it&#039;s primitive denizens.

Results pending.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
Had to be at work this morning so only stayed for the first feature.  Excellent!
What was the name of the film please? (The French one based on Little Red Ridinghood, with mushroom costumes)

Thanks&#039;

		<description><![CDATA[This looks like a very good event. I heard many good comments from those who attended (always a good sign). Nice to see that it has no sense of culture funded (logo) activity on the ad.
