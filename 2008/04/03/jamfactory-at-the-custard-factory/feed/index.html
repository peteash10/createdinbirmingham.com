		<description><![CDATA[Aww, thank you ever so much for blogging the Jam &#038; Custard launch, I really really appreciate it!

I decided to have the show in Birmingham because Go Go Plastic! is a fantastic independant store and Im originally from the midlands (Leicester) so I wanted something close to my hometown!

Thanks again and hope you can make the show!

All the best and keep up the great blog,

~ Gav.]]></description>
