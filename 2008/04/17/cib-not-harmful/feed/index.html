		<description><![CDATA[I saw this Google result for the first time today, and have to say that it&#039;s an irresponsible tactic, particularly if it is highlighting pages that aren&#039;t actively corrupting my machinery. It&#039;s a sure way to drive people away from worthwhile sites. After googling the offending phrase and finding a bunch of stories like yours, I am thinking the line deserves to be replaced with

&lt;a&gt;Scaremongering by Google&lt;/a&gt;

Furthermore, I&#039;m not convinced by the Badware site. More hysteria. It looks as though they report sites based on very thin evidence, such as if there&#039;s a link to a site that&#039;s been identified (or misidentified) as corrupt. Bad.]]></description>

sâ€™cos thereâ€™s too many websites which want to do things like shake your browser, move it about, &#038; resize it to the size *they* want you to have your browser rather than the size *you* want it, innit.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
