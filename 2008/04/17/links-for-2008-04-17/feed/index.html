		<description><![CDATA[youmeo is new, if I read correctly, I&#039;d heard of pplparty.. got an account on there somewhere. The new site looks good, features could give facebook a run for there money? I agree with empty profiles tho..

I don&#039;t think we support local companies enough, hence why all the success stories are abroad. I say c&#039;mon bham.. or Coventry even!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[having a look at youmeo.com, i have to admit (&#038; call me cynical if you will) to being dubious - it&#039;s amazing that a social networking site based in the uk which nobody here appears to have heard of can boast so many members, &#038; that when one does searches for combinations of people choosing some fairly obscure search criteria, it still claims &#039;100+ pages&#039; of results - yet when you look at the profile pages they&#039;re all &#039;new on here&#039; with no friends yet. i reckon most of the members are made up just to make the place look busy.

i do wonder if there&#039;s any point in a new social networking site with general reach entering the market at a time when myspace, facebook, &#038; bebo have pretty much got saturation coverage (&#038; are indeed apparently now in decline); i&#039;d say for new entrants to the market to have any point they&#039;d need to be niche rather than general.]]></description>
