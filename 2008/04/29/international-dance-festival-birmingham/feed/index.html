		<description><![CDATA[Nice spot Chris. I haven&#039;t had a chance as yet to write about this myself (too busy organising bits of it!) but you&#039;re right to say it&#039;s going to be a good one. This weekend has a bit of everything - Birmingham&#039;s Rosie Kay in a newly commissioned piece on Friday, Cuban dance at the Hippodrome, flamenco workshops, youth dance and ballroom dance in the town hall. And then there&#039;s Watch This Space, which should be a great event - think dance, parkour (freerunning), scrap cars, pyrotechnics and more...
And do try to check out On Display (the project in the shops) it&#039;s really quite interesting in a kind of public art/candid camera/flashmob type way...check the website for times/locations...
I will suggest the collective memories thing - I think this would be great.]]></description>
