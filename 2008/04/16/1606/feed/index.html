		<description><![CDATA[Belated Response to Romulus, Remus and their Minion:

First you (Romulus and Remus) use someone&#039;s copyrighted material without their permission, (SEE http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2007/12/17/look-at-me-i-get-funding/) then you cry spam when that person makes comments on your oh so precious blog.   Then one of your minions chips in masterfully (not) to further rubbish Ms Proops while, at the same time, launching his tongue up the buttocks of the founders of Rome.  

Well done.  Toss another one off boys!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Romulus and Remus - may I address you thus?  May I also apologise on behalf of Wilma Proops?  You are right, comedy IS NOT an Art - it&#039;s more (how shall we put this . . .) for people who don&#039;t/can&#039;t understand Art.  Art has to be relevant to us not them - I feel you understand this point even if Mrs Proops (and her type) doesn&#039;t/cannot.  Fear not Romulus and Remus  - it is exactly for such as Wilma that I champion Birmingham Art&#039;s flagship campaign to Favour Arts Retarded Targets.  Coupled with the Scientific Monitoring of Egalitarian Gain we will educate the likes of Mrs Proops and improve their dismal diction via the Arts but ALSO monitor Arts uptake by this lowly demographic!  

I commend the way you addressed this woman.  There is nothing funny about Art.  People like us should stand together - what would Art be without the likes of us?  Keep up the good work!  Proops et al are irritants and should be put in their place.  Well done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m tempted to just say &quot;oh fuck off&quot; but that probably wouldn&#039;t be helpful, so I&#039;ll just point out that this has never been a gig listings blog (that would be impossible and pointless), that we don&#039;t generally cover comedy (no reason, and please don&#039;t get into the &quot;what is creative?&quot; debate as &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is ultimately creative) and that you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2007/11/29/wilma-proops/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;had a mention&lt;/a&gt; last November despite being rather irritating. 

Yes, there&#039;s a bias here. That&#039;s because it&#039;s run by humans who are biased. I&#039;ve never tried to say otherwise as to try and be completely representative and impartial is a fool&#039;s errand. If you don&#039;t like the blog please start your own. It&#039;s easy and Birmingham needs more blogs. 

Etc, blah...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sweetheart - you have failed to mention RED HAT NO DRAWERS the stage comedy even though it was created in Birmingham, promoted by a website that was created in Birmingham, was written by a writer who was created in Birmingham, directed by a director who was created in Birmingham, acted by actors, both of whom were, created in Birmingham and produced in a theatre that was   created in Birmingham.  Perhaps you should rename your website - abitofwhatiscreatedinbirminghamaslongasIlikeit.com
that would be far more apt I feel.  I may be wrong - perhaps you&#039;ll right this massive wrong before it is too late.  The Comedy (for adults only and not the sensitive types) is on until Saturday 19th April at The Old Joint Stock Theatre - starts 8pm, tickets are Â£6.50 and available from their box office 0121 200 0946]]></description>
