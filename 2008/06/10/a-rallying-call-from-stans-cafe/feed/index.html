		<description><![CDATA[Ok, so &#039;risk&#039; is the wrong word.  I mean presumably you knew you liked Eugene&#039;s gypsy-punk ways.  I guess I just mean trying something new.

The other thing about James&#039; article is that he seems to be saying art deserves an audience just for being there and people should seek it out.  There&#039;s been a fair amount of &#039;taking art to the people&#039; recently with Fierce &amp; the Int Dance Festival.  Hmm, think that&#039;s edging towards another discussion altogether.

Yeah, home time now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Surely everything someone goes to is a risk... I went to see Gogol Bordello recently and it was great, but it could have been awful, they might not have been in the mood.  The last thing I went to that I was unsure about was part of Birmingham Book Festival that happened in the old Ikon Eastside - it wasn&#039;t life changing, it wasn&#039;t the worst thing I&#039;ve ever seen, it wasn&#039;t a risk though.  I went because I wanted to go... even if it had been terrible you can&#039;t change the fact that you wanted to go initially.

Now I don&#039;t want to go and see caberet at Legs 11... that would be a risk, but at the same time I&#039;m quite sure I&#039;m not going to go to it, so won&#039;t be taking that risk.

I&#039;m rambling... is it home time yet?]]></description>
