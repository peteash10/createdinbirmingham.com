		<description><![CDATA[Surely a storyline will be given to it retrospectively, irrespective of what was planned?

Localised- rather than meta- narratives.  Is that Lyotard?

(Load of drunken nonsense attempting to tie this in to existentialism deleted before very nearly being posted.  I suspect I&#039;ll be glad of my own prudence about this tomorrow).

I said elsewhere that I&#039;m not sure I understand this game but I think I like it anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Emergent Game could really be classed as Alternate Reality because the Ludens aren&#039;t involved in an over-arching storyline.

Someone suggested &quot;Collaborative Production Game&quot; with reference to http://sf0.org/, but if we&#039;re borrowing from their text I&#039;d take this as a damn-fine starting point:

&quot;SFZero: An interface for San Francisco. That is to say, a new representation for the data that&#039;s already there. Your mind is full of /inaccurate/ representations that are affecting the way you use the San Francisco dataflow: steering you away from interaction and collaboration and towards unproductive reflexive data loops (forNext). SFZero designers are working double-shifts to engineer this next-generation interface that will bring you together with your cohabitants to experience the freedom that is /hard-coded/ into San Francisco&#039;s protocol.&quot; 

[Replace &quot;San Francisco&quot; with any location of your choice]]]></description>
