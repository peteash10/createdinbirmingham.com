		<description><![CDATA[Yes I am Liam, and for exactly the reason I&#039;ve outlined.  

I was also involved in setting it up last year and I would have loved to have seen more people from the creative sector included.  The harsh fact was that very few of the people that I&#039;m sure we both know were known more widely in the city.  Funny enough, some of the people I argued to be on the list have made posts above...just as well I didn&#039;t succeed?!

Being serious, what I learnt was that if you want to change things, you have to do it from the inside.  That doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that you have to go native; you just have to learn the language ;Â¬D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A CiB Power 50 would be great - but surely just as subjective and representative of CiB&#039;s editorial stance as is the Post&#039;s version?

I think you&#039;ve missed the point here: the list isn&#039;t that important but the debate which follows is.  The people from creative/media industries may not be your choices but they are the ones who&#039;ve got on the radar of the typical Post reader and therefore decision-maker in this city.

Isn&#039;t there a saying about it&#039;s better to be inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I whole heartedly agree with Liam Byrne re Soweto Kinch and Graham Vick. Their power is in their creativity and vice versa, and lists such as these should in my view reflect more such individuals who are entrepreneurially shifting the symbolic understanding of the city, inside and outside the city. Perhaps too much attention in these lists falls on the &#039;funderati&#039; who hold the purse rather than on those who - imaginatively - spend the cash.However, dialectically speaking,  you cant have one with out the other. But more of the other is, as we know, can be a good thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Stuart and Chris â€“ it is well-read toss.

A list that rates a persons ability to influence or control is always going to be controversial owing to its subjective nature. 

Despite the diverse judging panel (Radisson SAS?), the rankings are representative of the Post editorial stance. Like all other print media, the content is written to appeal to their readership which comprises in the main, of opinion-formers, decision makers and policy shapers throughout the region.

Regardless of this, I applaud the inclusion of Soweto Kinch and Graham Vick as both have strived to push integration between art, music and communities higher up Birminghamâ€™s agenda. 

Maybe a CiB Power 50?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris

My initial comment was quite flippant but i stand by it. I don&#039;t see how this is about pushing the city forward.

Who does this matter to? The list just seem like a futile endeavor when surely there are better ways in honoring some great things that some of the people on the list have achieved.

Maybe I a am being over cynical about this. I&#039;d be interested to see what other people think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nah, I&#039;d rather talk about if/why it&#039;s toss than just dismiss it.

Maybe it&#039;s not toss - maybe it&#039;s quite valuable, especially in a city that some say doesn&#039;t do enough to put itself forward.

Then again, maybe it is toss - but it&#039;s quite well-read toss and it _matters_ to some people.  So, thinking pragmatically, what would make it better?

I&#039;m just not into the idea of hoping something will go away - maybe I&#039;m wrong.]]></description>
