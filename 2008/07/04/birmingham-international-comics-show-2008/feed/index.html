		<description><![CDATA[What..  Pete... you don&#039;t know Michael Golden?? You must be fibbing! : )

As you know I&#039;m not really big into the superhero stuff myself, but there will - of course- also be a huge amount of Indy publisers present at the show, so there really is something for everyone.

all the best

		<description><![CDATA[Trust me, those international names are lost on me too. I know my comics but I don&#039;t know who&#039;s hot in the world of superheroes. 

If they shipped Kevin Huizenga or Seth over I&#039;d be blogging the shit out of this but it ain&#039;t my scene really. 

(Be nice to see some old comics buddies in the bar though, which is what these thigns are all about really!)]]></description>
