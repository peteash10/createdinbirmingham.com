		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I&#039;m starting my degree in Media in September this year at BCU Birmingham, and am very keen to work in the radio industry in the future. I&#039;ve heard about your new station-to-be and liked the idea of having a creative basis and audience. I was wondering if I might be able to come for some experience or voluntary work once its all been launched? I would be grateful if you considered me for this. Many thanks, Craig Simms.]]></description>
