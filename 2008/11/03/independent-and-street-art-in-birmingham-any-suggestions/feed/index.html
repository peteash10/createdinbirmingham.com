		<description><![CDATA[If anyone knows of any black street artists in Birmingham can you please ask them to contact me.  I am interested in putting in a proposal with Punch Records to create a piece of work about the influence that Africa has had on the arts in Birmingham.

Thanks,

		<description><![CDATA[She could certainly mention International Project Space at Bournville...

http://www.internationalprojectspace.org/aboutips.htm

...perhaps as a lead-in to mentioning the bevy of summer art &#038; design graduate shows that happen each year.  She might also mention fine art photography, with intimate venues such as The Light House gallery in Wolverhampton (hopefully she&#039;s not sticking precisely to the Birmingham city boundaries). And while she&#039;s talking about Wolverhampton, she might mention Initial Access...

There will also be MAC, which will be presumably putting on visual art shows once it re-opens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cheers Kate, not sure many of us would describe ourselves as very &#039;street&#039; but yeah, Moseley Arts Market. Also, the Sunday Flea, Ltd Edition and some of the other newer events that have popped up lately. The new (or restarted rather) Moor St Station Markets are a fairly independent reaction to there being not many other chances for designer/makers and artists to trade in the City Centre. Although we are collaborating with Chiltern Railways to do it and we did have to get permission from the Council. www.moorstmarkets.wordpress.com]]></description>
