		<description><![CDATA[@simon_gray in that case, wouldn&#039;t a better name for the event be the Creative Business Awards? That could have real legs, and could even work nationally.

Instead of awards for design, filmmaking and so on based on the quality of the end product/service like all the others, an award based on the quality of strategy/business development could be really interesting. (You could argue against pretty easily too, but hey.)

I guess the problem here is one of perceptions (I&#039;ve won two of these awards and haven&#039;t entered again) but I thought it was just an awards ceremony for anyone working in creative industries! 

Shows what I know... but I did think it was odd that I was trying to find a category to nominate Emily and found it difficult even though she has a great story (new mum, finishing a PhD, starting a successful business single-handed, etc.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s worth remembering that the creative city awards are (a) self-nominating, &#038; (b) all about the &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; side of running a creative business, rather than the creative side of it.

this isn&#039;t to defend either the awards in general or this year&#039;s list, but it may explain what appear to be odd choices &#038; omissions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was only jesting Chris - always happy to get info onto CIB - badge of honour in fact. 

Digital Native Academy are great by the way. Serious Games applications in community setting. Done work with Microsoft amongst others. Did a project in Sandwell called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=8987381&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gaming the Tibby&lt;/a&gt; (more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laws.sandwell.gov.uk/ccm/content/community-and-living/safer-stronger-communities-fund/gaming-the-tibby.en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Billy - maybe I&#039;m too much of a purist but I&#039;m still not sold on the creativity of SEO and PPC.  You&#039;re right though, I&#039;ve not seen any (potentially perfectly good) explanations for their nominations.

You&#039;re right on Adwords Ltd too. I suspect the list should say Adwords Expert Ltd (based in Moseley) whose website is http://www.adwords-expert.co.uk/ (link above amended).

Dave - apologies but I didn&#039;t realise you (or Kenny or the Bham Post for that matter) were trying to spark a debate and didn&#039;t intend to steal any thunder.

For the record (and to defend my honour) I looked up the names of the companies that weren&#039;t familiar to me (Bubblequest, DA Recordings, Adwords, IE Design, Internet Arrow, Violectra, LHM and Digital Native) when I saw Kenny&#039;s post. I originally copied Kenny&#039;s list for this post and started adding links but replaced it with your one (credited) when I saw I was just duplicating work.]]></description>
