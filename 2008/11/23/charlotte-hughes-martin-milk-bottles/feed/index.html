		<description><![CDATA[Hello Charlotte,
its Frank the milk man from gnosall (No longer with the great moustache).
I am glad to see that you are doing well with your art work. I do remember one or two etching on bottles, but i did not realise you had done them, i asumed they were on the bottles when i delivered them, but obviously i was wrong. Nice to hear that you have mentioned me. Would be happy to hear from you. Best regards Frank Anstey (Gnosall milk man)]]></description>
