		<description><![CDATA[Well pull my daisy! straight from the fridge Daddy-O!

Written in only 20 days but 7 years to live the journey - what a privilege to host one of the most important pieces of literature ever.

		<description><![CDATA[This is a great event. I have seen the Scroll in New York and it is mesmerizing. Everyone needs to go and see this incredible piece of history. You can really feel Jack. 
Also I was lucky to also see the movie &quot;One Fast Move and I&#039;m Gone&quot; when it premiered in Lowell for the Lowell Celebrates Kerouac week in October. This was only the second time it was shown in North America, so I felt blessed. It is an awesome work. Really lays out the soul of Kerouac. 
Good Luck with your Jack Kerouac celebration...you&#039;re about to venture into impossible greatness!]]></description>
