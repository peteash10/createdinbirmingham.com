		<description><![CDATA[I have a dream that one day Birmingham and the surrounding areas will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all creativity are created equal.&quot; I have a dream that one day on the red bricks of Birmingham, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a table of culturehood. I have a dream that one day even the all parts of Birmingham, a fragile city, sweltering with the heat of cultural injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of creative freedom, justice and equality. I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a city where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their creative character. I have a dream today.

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking in a personal capacity, rather than on behalf of the organisation,  I for one am deeply flattered:  in just six short months Creative Republic has gone from a small group of committed individuals who want to raise the profile of the cultural and creative excellence in the region to a &quot;mainstream&quot; bastion of secrecy complete with hidden agendas!  Result!

If Mr/Miss/Mrs/Ms B would like to talk to me about what CR are REALLY doing (I am its Chair) or if he/she would like to attend a board meeting as an observer, or apply to join the board in order to promote counter culture inside the  organisation (I use the word loosely)itself he/she is MORE than welcome. Call me - 0121 244 8082. 

But I can see that promoting counterculture inside what aspires to be an high profile representation body has inherent contradictions.  I don&#039;t want to p*ss on the metaphorical counter-cultural bonfire but I do want to emphasise that he/she is welcome, as is anyone who is broadly in favour of our aims (which, for transparency are set out in full in our charter - www.creativerepublic.org.uk/charter).  You&#039;re also welcome if you are not in favour of our aims, but that strikes me as a slightly more challenging co-operation, but I&#039;m sure we&#039;d work something out.

Also I think Pete Ashton, founder of this august weblog, runs technical surgeries for bloggery in the city so he can sort you out with your set up.  Am I right Pete?

Personally I&#039;m looking forward to being alerted to the things I might otherwise miss in the rich cultural seam of the West Midlands, so keep them postings coming say I!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi. Firstly, big apologies for the email notification mistake. I&#039;m new to this and I&#039;ve now sorted it out.

Just to say, that whilst I have made some comments, some in big letters in my own vernacular, I am hoping to pass post blog number 5! This site, whilst I ramble in my own way, aims to promote counterculture(as well as demote mainstream culture where I think it seems fitting. I will indeed do both! So if there is anything countercultural happening in Birmingham and the surrounding areas, I am willing to promote! Whilst it does seem that I have pointed the finger at this point in time, I certainly don&#039;t want this blogsite to just be about pointing fingers and moaning per se. I am keen, for example, to champion bygone countercultural material as well as contemporary countercultural activity here in Birmingham and surrounding areas(is there an archive about past countercultural activity to date here in Birmingham?). I think there are some great things that have gone on here in Brum and I intend this blog to essentially be affirmative, allowing and adding to the city&#039;s development c/o debate/promotion/demotion. For this reason, for the blog to be an additional and alternative voice and perspective. Interestingly, not all my blogs are simply personally opinionated as such....I like to open a can of worms every now and then. It&#039;s good to see what&#039;s inside!

		<description><![CDATA[It does look a bit mad, but I do believe it&#039;s necessary, there&#039;s too much toeing the party line going on in this town right now and nowhere really where people can vent their spleens.  Hopefully Mr Anonymous will read this stuff and switch off his comment subs. It could be a lot of fun if people stick with it. I for one am ready for a good old rant at the injustice of it all!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From the looks of the first two posts, I suspect that B will have twisted itself in conceptual knots by post #5.

@Pete: perhaps this person would benefit from some editorial and technical guidance.  However, it also seems possible that  blogs/bloggers such as CiB and yourself might be regarded as part of the culture to be countered. Oh the complications!]]></description>
