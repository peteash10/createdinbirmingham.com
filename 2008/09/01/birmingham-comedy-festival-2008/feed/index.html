		<description><![CDATA[To my knowledge the key local you haven&#039;t pointed out is Jo Enright (very funny, does a great routine about Erdington High Street). She was recently in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/labrats/behindthescenes/enright.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lab Rats&lt;/a&gt;. She&#039;s at the Crescent on the 5th October on a night called &#039;Birmingham Comedy Selection&#039; so the others on the bill are presumably locals as well. 

The legendary Ted Chippington is a Brummie of course as CIB has &lt;a&gt;previously pointed out&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s worth repeating though as the man is fantastic. Take a look at Stewart Lee&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2007/feb/03/features16.theguide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Guardian article&lt;/a&gt; as well as the video for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcXj_ZdKmcQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Culture Show&lt;/a&gt;. Ironman Records &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Ted-Chippington-Walking-down-the-road-4CD-Boxset-2007_W0QQitemZ160110195227QQihZ006QQcategoryZ1049QQcmdZViewItem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stock a CD&lt;/a&gt; of Ted&#039;s work. Ted is  supported by another local guy, Nadeem Rangzeb. 10th Oct, Hare and Hounds.

Also, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedycv.co.uk/seanpercival/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sean Percival&lt;/a&gt; is from Dudley (Glee 9-11th Oct).

The two Brummies I thought would be at the festival are local stalwart Andy Robinson and now nationally recognised comedian, author and broadcaster, Natalie Haynes. Hey, hang on, I made a documentary 12 years ago about those two gigging around Brum - cue plug: &lt;a href=&quot;http://daveharte.com/birmingham/stand-up-comedy-circa-1996/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#039;Stand-up Comedy circa 1996&#039;&lt;/a&gt;.

Comedy does seem to get only very rare mentions on CIB which is a shame as its as much a cultural activity as much of the other stuff featured.
