		<description><![CDATA[Hi I just wanted to say thank you for CIB for helping to make our event a success.

The Something Foundation is very very new and we started with a bang. We hope to be getting some exciting shows going in the Stourbridge, Wolverhampton and Dudley areas. As well as coming back to the big smoke soon!

Cheers for you post
