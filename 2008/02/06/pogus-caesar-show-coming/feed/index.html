		<description><![CDATA[That Beautiful Thing by Pogus Caesar at Three White Walls Art Gallery

28th August â€“ 7th October 2008
 
Three White Walls Art Gallery in the Mailbox in Birmingham will be displaying photographs by renowned artist, photographer and filmmaker Pogus Caesar, 28th August until 7th October 2008. 

That Beautiful Thing, previously exhibited at the Wolverhampton Art Gallery, 26 April- 12 July 2008, will showcase photographs taken over a period of more than 20 years of Caesarâ€™s career, both in the UK and abroad, and will demonstrate his talent for depicting the world at large with acute and touching observations of events and humanity. 

Caesar is best known for his 35mm black and white photography and compelling photomontages, which he shoots on old Nikon and Cannon Sure Shot cameras purchased in the 80s. He still expresses excitement at seeing, capturing and then printing the image and the mystery of the end result. Caesar said of his practice:

â€™There is no particular method, I work instinctively, seeing the story, then trusting my camera&#039;. 

Most of Caesarâ€™s UK photography is based around his home city of Birmingham and includes documenting well known personalities such as Stevie Wonder, Desmond Tutu and actress Julie Christie as well as important events such as the Handsworth riots and the Birmingham tornado. Internationally, Caesar has visited places as diverse as South Africa, Spain, Albania, America and India to photograph people and events.]]></description>
