		<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone
Thank you for your comments and I hope you enjoyed the Parade yesterday. We, as a voluntary committee, appreciate your input. As my colleague said earlier we don&#039;t have a budget for this and we aren&#039;t experts - we wanted to get the information out there. We have received correspondance from Louis as mentioned above and at our debrief we will look seriously into this. In the meantime we look forward to seeing you all at an event soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wrote - in a personal capacity - to the organisers in 2002, offering them free advice on improving the accessibility of their then website. At my instigation, so did Julie Howell, then of the RNIB.  I received a curt reply from the festival organisers, suggesting I &quot;come up to Birmingham&quot; and do the work myself. To the best of my knowledge, none of the recommended changes (such as using meaningful alt text) were made.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@pd - the (former ?) webmaster of the pushbikes site is somebody whose reputation for being convinced he&#039;s right &#038; the rest of the world is wrong goes back over 10 years.

i remember one memorable posting from him to the old newsgroup uk.local.birmingham where he was slating microsoft for windows crashing on him (back in the day of windows 3.11). turned out he had completely rearranged his file system so all the executable files were in a folder &#039;exes&#039;, all the dll files were in a folder &#039;dlls&#039;, all the jpg files were in a folder &#039;jpgs&#039; etc. you get the picture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2004 I spent a couple of hours fixing the navigation on this site - http://www.pushbikes.freeserve.co.uk/ so it was valid xhtml/css (try it in a non internet explorer browser). The &#039;webmaster&#039; said thanks but I&#039;m going to keep it as it is along with this message http://www.pushbikes.freeserve.co.uk/nonmsie.htm 
LOL! - it&#039;s not my site it&#039;s your browser and the w3c that are wrong! I decided not to join Pushbikes. This site still gets updated even though someone with sense has set up http://www.pushbikes.org.]]></description>
