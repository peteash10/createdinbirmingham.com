		<description><![CDATA[Just one note on the new Bearded site - it is still work in progress. It will relaunch with more knobs and bits and bobs on 1 March.

Also, the new Bearded is out now, available at all the usual places - Bull&#039;s Head, Sunflower lounge, Swordfish, Tempest, Polar Bear and that awesome record shop around the corner from me in Moseley that I can never remember the name of. If you can&#039;t find one I still have a few available. Just get in touch if you fancy one. It&#039;s free and it&#039;s pretty, and it has Pete taking a few pictures of Efterklange in it.]]></description>
