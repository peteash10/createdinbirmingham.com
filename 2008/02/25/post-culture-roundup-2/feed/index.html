		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I know that and you know that and I&#039;m sure the tech bods behind the Post&#039;s site know that but I&#039;m not holding my breath.

Ten4 wiped out their entire archive when they changed from Ideas Factory and I fully expect them to vanish again when they switch to 4Talent. Maybe. It&#039;s still a little confusing over there.

		<description><![CDATA[Broken links? Surely not!

It&#039;s relatively straight forward to make a long list of all of the links on the site, put them into a database and then do 403: Moved Permanently redirects on them to their new homes.
