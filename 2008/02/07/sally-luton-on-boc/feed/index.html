		<description><![CDATA[On a professional level I assist and support Bimingham Opera Company with their Audience Development Activity as their account Manager at Audiences Central. 

However on a personal level I was lucky enough to be involved in La Traviata at the NIA as part of there community chorus. 

I must say that I found the experience life changing, inspiring, engaging, educational, community enhancing and thoroughly enjoyable.  I have also developed a new personal audience for opera in my 7 month old son who was often besieged by my constant warblings and singing practice. 

As a keen supporter and advocate of Birmingham Opera Company and also of the unheralded and dedicated work of the West Midlands Arts Council regional office, I&#039;m really pleased to hear that conversations are taking place to help generate a shared path to success that will allow Birmingham Opera Company to continue to be one of the unrivalled creative pioneers of the region. 

After all I&#039;m a chorus singer now and need all the avenues to the stage I can get :)]]></description>
