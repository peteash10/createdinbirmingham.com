Thanks for that Pete - but thanks to the genius of MADE Media (who know about these things more than we do) - the threat to our e-mail is over and they will be diverted to a series of different addresses.

SO - it&#039;s business as usual at Fierce e-mail - which is something of a relief to us and I hope to all of you out there!

Thanks again Pete, and thanks to Made Media who have taken the problem from our hands...

We&#039;ll just stick to what we&#039;re best at - leaving pianos in the street, hanging people naked off buildings, sticking nests on iconic buildings and letting you programme our festival (www.myfiercefestival.co.uk)!!!]]></description>
