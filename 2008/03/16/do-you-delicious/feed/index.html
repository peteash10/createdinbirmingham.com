		<description><![CDATA[You won&#039;t be entirely shocked to learn that Andrew Dubber pointed me at this a couple of years ago. It&#039;s excellent and the only thing that lets it down is me when I forget to use it.

I&#039;ll add you in to anything of interest I see from now on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;ll add you in on the tags when I find stuff. I&#039;ve turned the resources for Iron Man into tagged Delicious bookmarks rather than filing them away onto pages, the ones with relevance to Birmingham I&#039;ll tag for you too
cheers

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s probably not very obvious but those links that appear every day or so at 5am, they come in automatically from del.icio.us.

Another use I heard of (from Antonio Gould I think) was for a business to have one person who monitors the feeds and adds relevant stuff to delish which is then emailed to everyone in the office using Feedburner as a daily digest of stuff they should know about. Quick and easy and, over time, creates a massive info bank for the business. 

There are bound to be more. It&#039;s a quite fantastic thing. Simple is the new powerful and all that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice to see you using del.icio.us Pete. I&#039;ve been a big advocate of it for a few years, using it to share links, populate link lists and blogs, exchange ideas with students, that kind of thing. Anyone thought of any other great uses?]]></description>
