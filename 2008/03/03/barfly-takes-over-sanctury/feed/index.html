There&#039;s city council and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.advantagewm.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AWM&lt;/a&gt; money in the refurb presumably through regeneration zone funds no doubt. The Barfly venue at the back will increase to 600 as part of the refurb and The Sanctuary will revert back to being The Institute.

		<description><![CDATA[I saw the Sanctuary was closed - I hope this is why!  Let&#039;s hope the new venue becomes the effective Academy replacement.  Much more character (I have fond memories of seeing Mogwai there) - indeed, I hope they don&#039;t arse this up in refurbishing and refitting &quot;with state of the art facilities&quot;.  Frankly I&#039;d rather see it open sooner and a lot grubbier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great news - about time we had a mid-level venue in Brum...and the Barfly needs a bit of an over-haul!

Anyone know any more about the future of the Academy  and when it&#039;s likely to move??]]></description>
