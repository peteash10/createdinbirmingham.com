		<description><![CDATA[Or even &#039;Going through the change&#039; - like music industry HRT...

I take Pete&#039;s point that coming up with titles for projects is darn tricky but, for me personally, it&#039;s the making up of words or &#039;wacky&#039; spelling that gets wearing. Unless there&#039;s some reason for the Z, like it&#039;s run by &#039;Z Productions Ltd&#039; or, as dp suggests, they&#039;re celebrating the much overlooked musical form of &#039;Tranz&#039;, then it can make you look a bit like the project wearing the cartoon tie and saying &#039;Oh, I&#039;m mad I am&#039;. Then again, it made me notice it I suppose, so could just be a genius marketing ruse.

I should point out though that this is a flippant response, it doesn&#039;t actually bother me that much and I&#039;m not sitting up at night looking at the flyer and sobbing quietly to myself. Honest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see what you mean. I also wouldn&#039;t want to write bumpf for something I didn&#039;t like. In this case I&#039;d have supplied a translation, like &#039;Making the change&#039;. It would have helped minimise my annoyance with their attempts to be clever.

Your use of transitionising is a bit ambigious in that regard. I took it as humourous. But, do you expect us to ignore every grammatical faux-pas? Or do you prefer the occasional retort?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s my age. The creative spelling is fine - especially because it might refer to some category of music that I don&#039;t know of. &lt;em&gt;Tranz&lt;/em&gt;, anyone? But is that as trainz, or trannz? 

What&#039;s annoying abut that particular title is the use of obscure verbs when plain English is far better. The use of &#039;transition&#039; and &#039;transitioning&#039; (yeah, you too Pete) is a fuzzy substitute for change, pass, shift; a washout word in place of a an emphatic one. 

If I were setting out on a career in music, an event about transitioning would equate to a composition for &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Muzak&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Muzak&lt;/a&gt;, the background music for offices. And maybe that&#039;s where the Z comes in. It&#039;s corporate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can lesson one be learning how to spell transition please? No doubt they&#039;d tell me to &#039;chillax&#039; and stop worrying about it. Gosh, I appear to be a bit of a language pedant. Who&#039;d have thought it?]]></description>
