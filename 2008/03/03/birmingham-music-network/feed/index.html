		<description><![CDATA[Nice one Mark,

The music network site looks good and a much needed revival after previous &#039;set backs&#039;. functionality is the same basic one that CIB runs on - but unfortunately so is the style! - lets have some change of colours/ fonts for cosmetic reasons and also for the sake of not having to double check which one I&#039;m reading!

and when and where do we meet again?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Mark - exactly. There is absolutely no need for anyone to feel they can&#039;t get a blog sorted out if they want one. 

Hmm... feeling an idea coming on. Something to do with a &#039;social media surgery&#039;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[...but I have no ideas of my own.....ha ha. No, seriously...I haven&#039;t had time to finish the blog yet...it&#039;s a work in progress and things like layout, colour schemes and the rest will be dealt with in due course, it was just easier to copy Pete to start out before further changes are made....

Oh yeah and I managed it in about 50 minutes after a good friend spent 2 hours trying to get the hosting to work......

If I can do it, anyone else can do it too....]]></description>
