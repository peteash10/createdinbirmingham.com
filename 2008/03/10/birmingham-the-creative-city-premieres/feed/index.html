		<description><![CDATA[Just got back from this event.

The programme basically helped under-represented people into the creative careers they&#039;d perhaps dreamed of but never had either the confidence or business knowledge to make a real go of. The scheme gave them that boost, business-training and work experience to turn a part-time passion into a full-time career. 

Giovanni, aka Spoz, was at the screening today. He joined the scheme after being made redundant from his job as a chassis engineer at MG Rover. Towards the end of the programme he applied for - and was awarded - the position of Birmingham Poet Laureate 2006-7. Of course he read a poem for us - full-on audience shout-back and everything, it was about dads who do disco dancing ...!

There&#039;s a brochure about the programme going into the Birmingham Post over the next week or two I think, which&#039;ll have a bit more background to the whole project.

Nick of Podnosh was at the screening today and I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll have a much more interesting take on things than I, so keep an ear out for that ...]]></description>
