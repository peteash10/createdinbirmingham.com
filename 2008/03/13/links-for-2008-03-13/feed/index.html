		<description><![CDATA[I saw this last night at the Floodgate street venue.  I&#039;ll fess up immediately and say I am biased - I work for Fierce! who co-commissioned this piece - but I really urge anyone interested in film, theatre, unusual experiences and corridors to see this piece. 

It&#039;s funny, moving, terrifying, intriguing, mystifying, frustrating, exciting and beautiful - all in 90 minutes or so.  It is also another prime example of the exciting talent that Birmingham has to offer - a talent that is recognised - in the case of Stan&#039;s Cafe LITERALLY world-wide - but is often overlooked in our own fair city.  Haul your ass to the dark side of Digbeth - buy your ticket (also available from mac - 0121 440 3838) and marvel.  

Thank whoever it is that you want to thank that you live in a city as interesting as Birmingham!]]></description>
