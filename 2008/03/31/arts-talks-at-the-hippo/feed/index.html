		<description><![CDATA[Oh how this city hates success.  We should be celebrating the achievements of the speakers and participants (who are in actual fact mainly local).  Butâ€¦â€¦..lets not limit ourselves to local ideas for local people particularly in light of the fact that you may well represent the local.  Please, Dr whinging, parochial curmudgeon keep your generalisations and ill formed assumptions to yourself. Frankly Iâ€™m glad you will be boycotting the events because there will be more room for people able to articulate a wider perspective on the art world than that which lies in your front room.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Without getting into the politics of whatever you&#039;re on about, Mr Ethics, I&#039;d suggest getting more grassroots stuff going on and, most importantly, documenting it online. That way there won&#039;t be a need for the top-down bollocks.

Personally even if the talks are wank it&#039;ll be a nice chance to go for a drink with some folks. I haven&#039;t caught up with Matt Price for a while, for example, and he&#039;s a dead interesting chap. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More top-down bollocks we don&#039;t need, stuffed full of the usual wannabes who should really bog off to London and let Brum get on with the grassroots stuff we need to develop.  As far as I know this was organised by agencies (and put together by a London-based org). Also, as far as I am aware, some of the artists on the bill weren&#039;t even asked to be involved, but were put on the publicity without their say-so, typical. I&#039;d like to see more artist-led stuff like this, rather than allowing others to impose it on us (and, yes, I have, do and will). Join me in boycotting this event and let&#039;s get off our butts and show them who is really in charge of the arts - artists!]]></description>
