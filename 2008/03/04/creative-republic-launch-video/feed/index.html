		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pete/all - thanks for a great site, been reading for a while and having watched the launch video for Creative Republic, wanted to let you know we&#039;ve alredy tentatively taken our first steps into the blog world with our recently-launched www.digishorts.co.uk site - bringing together a catalogue of fantastic digital short films from the region and, of course, a blog. We&#039;d love for your readers to check it out.

PS I know there&#039;s some work to do on the interface and it kinda lags way behind when it comes to feeds, social networking sharing etc - but there&#039;s more in the pipeline for this site, plus big plans to take the Screen WM site (www.screenwm.co.uk) in the same direction so you can hear more about film, TV and digital media activity in the West Mids straight from the horse&#039;s mouth, as it were.

Cheers

Dan @ SWM]]></description>
