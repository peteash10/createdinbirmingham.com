		<description><![CDATA[IIâ€™m really looking forward to this event. I sometimes feel a bit lonely as a creative video artist/ filmy type person, it would be great to meet some other people Brummy people who think spending their spare time in gardens at two in the morning setting up sheets and bamboo frames behind a car to make old style back projection was normalâ€¦
  
Wouldnâ€™t be lovely if an online community of amateur / filmersâ€™ was to kick off?  The discussion board on film Birmingham doesnâ€™t seem to really fulfil its potential to connect us.  It seems like I always need a favour or advice like borrowing a running machine or info on the cheapest place to rent lights.  My poor boyfriend (Danny) is getting seriously annoyed by being my voluntary crew (who can blame him were filming at 6 in the morning in town and geeks really value sleep).  

What im trying to gauge I guess is would anyone else be up for this kind of camaraderie?  
Would it be cool if we all had twitter so we could test out ideas ask how to do something or beg for those odd props filming requires? Or would it be lame and end up heading into idea theft territory? If I lent you my front room as a set would you hold my boom mic? 

I recon Pete will tell me to get off my ass and just do this â€“so if I did would anyone be interested?]]></description>
