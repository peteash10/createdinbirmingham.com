		<description><![CDATA[Nice to see this event mentioned - it was organised by the same members of Oscillate, ( Bobby Bird / Scylla Magda) who are still here in Birmingham, creating work and putting on occasional high end electronic arts and music events, as part of Modulate collective . On 31st May we are hosting an audio visual performance by Frank Bretschneider (Raster-Noton), more details at  http://www.modulate.org.uk.  

The CD Birmingham Frequencies is still available direct from Bobby&#039;s Headphone label (http:www.headphonerecords.co.uk). 

Co incidentally we are currently planning a similar project to Birmingham Frequencies with sound artist Fransisco Lopez (whom we brought to Birmingham last year to give a &#039;Total Darkness&#039; performance ) to take place in 2009, featuring Lopez plus a number of regional sound artists / musicians.]]></description>
