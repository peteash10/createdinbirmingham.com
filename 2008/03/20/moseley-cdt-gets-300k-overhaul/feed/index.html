		<description><![CDATA[With regards to Stef&#039;s comments on the &#039;creative&#039; part of the farmers market, true, in the past it was becoming ever more difficult for the CDT to run the Arts Market effectively with no guarantee of the number of stalls available from the farmers and various contacts in the CDT office dealing with enquiries, however it is now coordinated by myself, a regular trader on the market and single point of contact for all enquiries. Due to the number of traders wishing to trade at the market I have encouraged the CDT to hire 15 stalls every monthy for the rest of the year (bar the June Street Festival and our November Christmas Special where we will book 25, meaning we can now book traders in well in advance, ensuring new artist get a go and the market continues for those of us who have been trading at it for the last year or so. We now set up on the other side of the road from the farmers, establishing ourselves as a seperate market and giving ourselves our own identity. We are now in the position to advertise the Arts Market as a monthly event, confident that it will go ahead and that there will be sufficient quality makers selling a diverserange of goods. 

If you wish to apply please email moseleyartsmarket@hotmail.co.uk or download an application form from the Moseley CDT Arts Market page. I can only assume that if Stef was hoping to trade at the market, she enquired quite some time ago and hope that I have now restored her hope. If not, perhaps a visit to our first market of the year, tomorrow, Saturday 22nd March will change her mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pete - the author isn&#039;t showing up on the individual blog post page so with all of the new bloggers it could get confusing.

This sounds interesting, although if they make as much a hash out of this as our &#039;who are these muppets&#039; experience of dealing with them with the &#039;creative&#039; part of the farmers market I don&#039;t hold much hope.]]></description>
