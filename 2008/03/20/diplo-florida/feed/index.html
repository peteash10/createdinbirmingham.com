		<description><![CDATA[Pete, please give props to the talented Director and my good pal Ben Lister. Lots of people helped out on this.. it was a few years in the making with various tests and experiments to get to this point.. Ben is a super talented Director with music videos and short films under his belt.. who knows if he wins this he&#039;ll probably make a feature with the prize money!]]></description>
