		<description><![CDATA[Great ,about time. Birmingham should push itself to be the leading venue for photography.
There are a infinite amount of good photography galleries in London and in the North of England, but Birmingham ? .With the good work done by groups such as Rhubarb Rhubarb we are ideally placed to become the UK&#039;s premier location for photographic galleries and exhibitions.
So well done 3 white walls (can i have my own exhibition now please!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Three White Walls first opened in June 2006, but in a different space in The Mailbox, reopening in their current spot last May I think it was. 

Anyway ... they tend to have an eclectic range of exhibitions, so it&#039;s always worth having a look to see what&#039;s there next. A great one last year was Stella Mitchell and Wayne Hemingway&#039;s  &#039;Land of Lost Content&#039;, a collection of retro kitschness including Spanish wicker donkeys, ancient Amstrads and whiffy old airline chairs. Mitchell and Hemingway did a brief talk about the collection beforehand which was really interesting, so if you can wangle yourself an invite, always try to get along to the Private Views!]]></description>
