		<description><![CDATA[Hello. I&#039;d like to thank Pete and friends for attending last night. I was impressed by the willingness to be at my Subway launch at 1.30am, to delve a little into my world of Bristol Street Subway. Much appreciate the photos and postive review from Pete. This evening, there will be another &#039;launch&#039; at 1.30am (24th Jan 08- ealry hours) at the same location. Look forward to meeting people there. I personally found the ambience most suited the stillness of the city, a lack of distractions and anxiety that is so associated with any city, let alone a Subway, made for a relaxed description and tour of the work i am involved with. 
More site of special social interest exhibitions , albiet in a more peculiar and continued fashion, are ongoing throughout 2008. I&#039;ll certainly keep people informed. I email out from plot40@hotmail.com - so please get in touch should you want to.
Thanks once more,
Harry.
