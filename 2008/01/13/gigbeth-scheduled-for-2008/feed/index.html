		<description><![CDATA[I agree that it needs one big act or at least a few semi big acts to get the punters down there. I also think that the programme needs to be more informative on where the gigs are and at what time, first and foremost. A basic timetable then whatever bumf you need about the venues and promoters. This is just from a customer point of view, most people just wanna know whats on, where and what time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i think gigbeth should have spent some money on getting a big act for it to centre on. if the foo fighters had played, every f@%Â£ker would have turned up at the opening, and prolly gone to more of the festival...

so ok that&#039;s slightly unrealistic, but there must be a huge act of local origin who could be used to champion the thing. what about ozzy?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pete

I hadn&#039;t seen this yet - so thanks! 

To be clear - I am working towards another Gigbeth BUT as hinted at in the blurb Audiences Central have published we have some things to sort out first. I&#039;ll publish the whole report when it comes out with all the audience figures etc...

What is nice is that all the people I talk to (even those who witnessed stuff that didn&#039;t work!) seem to want it to happen again - which is why I have put the dates on our Myspace. Those are the dates I suspect we will use (as they coincide with Music Live again).

We will make a proper announcement when we have lined all the chips up!

Cheers

Clare]]></description>
