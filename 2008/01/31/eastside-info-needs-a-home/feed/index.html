		<description><![CDATA[discovered a little more...

Kinetic are working on a master plan for Warwick Bar, Eastside.
http://www.kinetic-aiu.com/warwick.html
Looks exciting!

There is an Eastside Community Group. Next meeting is at the old crown pub on the 20th feb 6pm. I have just spoken to Anne Parouty (Chair) who informs me that they have no web presence but have been keen to develop one. I will be attending the next meeting to see if we can get a blog set up to assist them in communicating their discussions, findings and views.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oops, I should proof read.

Second &quot;Curzon Gate&quot; should read &quot;Curzon Park&quot;.

Of interest, you can find out more that&#039;s going on at:

I&#039;d love to start an Eastside blog, as I work there every day.

		<description><![CDATA[Right, what&#039;s going on.  A lot in fact!

Millennium Point - finished in 2001 and now fully occupied.

Masshouse, phase two is underway, is at a snails pace though.

City Park - BCC have scaled it down after not winning the Lottery money.  It is still going ahead, just at a slower pace.

City Park Gate - Full planning consent, building work is imminent.

Etna House - Under construction, steel is current going up.

VTP 200 - Has outline planning, awaiting full planning after a slight re-design after public consultation. New designs have been shown to the public now.

Curzon Gate - 700 apartments, due for completion by the summer.

Curzon Gate - outline planning given.

Birmingham city University - outline planing give.  BIAD and Conservatoire are both moving to Eastside in the next 2010-2011.  This is the same land where the Lord Rogers library was planned to be.

Venture East - land is being cleared as we speak.  In for full planning in the next couple of months.

Multi-storey car park - Planning given.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hate to break this to you Pete but the pic to accompany this post may be of Digbeth but that ain&#039;t Eastside (actually it&#039;s of what they now call the &lt;a&gt;). That&#039;s according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Media/Eastside map.pdf?MEDIA_ID=214231&#038;FILENAME=Eastside map.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;map on the council website&lt;/a&gt; anyway.

You&#039;re right in that there&#039;s little public dialogue about Eastside yet there has been myriad strategies for it over the years. Even some very recent stuff that seems to have had little attention whatsoever. If I could pull my finger out and refocus on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strategydigested.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;strategy blog&lt;/a&gt;, I&#039;d have a go at listing them all. Might take me a while though. You could start with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sustainable-eastside.net/Eastside Vision March 2002.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;2002 Eastside Sustainability Vision&lt;/a&gt; but there are plenty of others. 

Having worked (and run and driven) around the place for a couple of years now it&#039;s clear that what was incremental change in the first half of the decade has suddenly speeded up, particulary in the &#039;upper&#039; part north of the railway line. 

Given that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowereastsidedialogues.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lower Eastside Dialogues&lt;/a&gt; guys still have a web presence of sorts I wonder if they&#039;d let someone use their space to continue the dialogue and start a blog?
