		<description><![CDATA[Are there two tunnels in that stretch? One that crosses under the Bristol Road near the auto dealer, and another to the north between the domed building and a 2nd-hand record shop on the corner at Bromsgrove Street? The pointer on your map is between the two. Go north/south a few metres and you&#039;ll spot the ramps. You might also note that it&#039;s a couple of roads away from that murder in a derelict building at Essex Street. A bit creepy for 1:30 then.]]></description>
