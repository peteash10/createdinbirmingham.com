		<description><![CDATA[no way. he used to come in to temple reprographics during the time he was laureate and whilst i worked there. he was printing a book as i recall. and although i didn&#039;t know him and wasn&#039;t even the one who was dealing with his work, he always seemed like he was pleased to see me and greeted me with his huge smile and a few kind words - so that has saddened me.
what did he die of? he wasn&#039;t very old was he?]]></description>
