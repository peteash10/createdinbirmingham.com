I agree - getting more background after seeing an exhibition gives the art more permanence and for me and I get a better understanding of it. 

But I emphasise the _after_ - I always read the exhibition notes after forming my own opinion. I didn&#039;t realise during the exhibition that there was content online that I could view after seeing it - they should make that more obvious on the wall of the exhibition so that I am reminded to go to the site on my return home.]]></description>
