		<description><![CDATA[@dave, I&#039;m not being an appoligist for BCC, but the image comes from iStockPhoto - whose images are watermarked so they couldn&#039;t have just downloaded it.

I was worried about this too, so I spent a good while comparing the images available on Google â€” some are similar (it must be a popular Alabama vantage point), but the one used is definitely from an image library. 

When you get there it&#039;s clearly labelled Alabama, so they may be stupid, but not ignorant of copyright.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This whole issue of Birmingham Council using a photo of Birmingham, Alabama they found on &#039;Google Image Bank&#039;, as I&#039;ve heard it called so many times, should raise another far more important issue - one of companies using images &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt;.

Just because the Internet has opened up images to the world doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;re not legally someone&#039;s copyrighted work and I think it&#039;s pretty appalling that an in-house design department (or worse, an agency, if BCC used one for this) is completely clueless about the legal use of sourced photography.]]></description>
