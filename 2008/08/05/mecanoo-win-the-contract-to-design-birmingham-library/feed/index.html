As I understand it the building is falling down a old well in between 
the two shops one is insured the
other isn&#039;t

The insurance company of the newsagents won&#039;t pay the whole bill so the owners 
of the restaurant have been given a
month to come up with the money or 
the council is going to erected the scaffolding inside the restaurant 
and charge them for doing so
