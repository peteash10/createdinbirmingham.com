		<description><![CDATA[I believe that if you sign up with Audiences Central that they offer their members a service to check for event clashes. If a few more arts organizations signed up with them maybe they could solve this? Obviously for big things its kind of &quot;save the date&quot; rather than publishing early which is a challenge for old media.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This obsession with Thursday in this city kind bugs me. There was fuckall going on on Tuesday and Wednesday this week yet everything&#039;s once again piled on the 4th day. Other than the thing I&#039;m in there are at least three things I&#039;d like to see tonight. Very irritating. 

It&#039;s great that there aren&#039;t enough days in the week to go around - shows the city is alive - but it&#039;s time to get a little creative methinks.]]></description>
