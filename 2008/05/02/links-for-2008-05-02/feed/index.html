		<description><![CDATA[This has been a gaping hole in Birmingham&#039;s media for a while - how do visitors find out about interesting stuff going on here? Or indeed casually interested locals? Whats On is free but has a pretty broad remit, and we could really do with something which regularly goes off the beaten track a bit more - along the lines of Venue in Bristol or The List in Glasgow. We produce a regular 7inch listings mailout (archived &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://7inch.wordpress.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;) and places like CiB and woib are trying to fill the gap, but to really do the job I think it&#039;ll need to happen in print as well as online, and have a strong editorial stance like this place - not just dependent on blurb from promoters. Here&#039;s hoping...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Amanda.  There&#039;s loads that CiB doesn&#039;t cover.  CiB isn&#039;t really a &#039;What&#039;s On&#039; and isn&#039;t meant to be anything like comprehensive.  We&#039;ll try and pick things out occasionally but for that sort of thing you&#039;d be best picking up a copy of What&#039;s On and starting there.

Or maybe a &#039;CiB recommends&#039; before each weekend would be a good idea.  Thoughts anyone?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I am an Australian artist visiting Birmingham for 4 days to see relatives. Just wanted to say that I found this blog when I searched for info on art to check out while I&#039;m here, and it seems to be a good resource for visitors. This &quot;links&quot; post is a useful way to locate some shows to catch, but as Birmingham is a biggish city, I&#039;m wondering if there is more around that isn&#039;t covered? Is there anyway you could  make &quot;what&#039;s on&quot; easier for a visitor to find quickly?]]></description>
