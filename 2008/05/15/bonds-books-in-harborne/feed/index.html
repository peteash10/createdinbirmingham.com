		<description><![CDATA[I kinda thought I&#039;d heard the same thing as well but couldn&#039;t recall where. It was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/magic-or-madness-harry-potters-final-instalment-457710.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article in the Independent&lt;/a&gt; from last year in which the owner says:

&quot;Sarah Bond took over the running of her bookshop Bonds Books in Harborne, Birmingham, four years ago, but she admits it has been a struggle. &#039;Unless something changes dramatically I am not sure whether I will continue when my lease is up in two years&#039; time,&#039; she says.&quot;
