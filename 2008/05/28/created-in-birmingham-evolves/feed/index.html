		<description><![CDATA[Nice concept for the font, but I agree that Sans Serif should be used for smaller text. Serif&#039;s aren&#039;t particularly dyslexia friendly and the creative industry&#039;s rammed with dyslexics like spazzo here. The posts seem a bit squashed up to the side too.  I think that could be fixed by making the CiB title the same width as the posts so as to make the eye flow. It might help distinguish the title &#038; menu from the text ad. It&#039;s nearly there though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always wondered how often people use calendars for navigation.  There&#039;s always the archive for the legacy thing.

As for listings, I&#039;m looking to pull something in from elsewhere - there&#039;s no way I can generate something myself.  I like the idea of calendar integration and there&#039;s a couple of ways that could work. Hmm.

Cheers for that.  More thoughts welcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right-ho here&#039;s a thought. 

The idea of day-by-day navigation, I like, as I said. 

As it&#039;s designed at the moment however, when we get to June, it looks as if all of May will disappear? This wouldn&#039;t be so useful after all. Also, I can&#039;t see there&#039;s currently a way of getting back further than May 1st, apart from clicking back page by page.

Perhaps more of a regular calendar sort of thing&#039;d do the trick, so we can search by day, week, month and even by year?

I think this sort of search could be useful, not least as a kind of legacy thing to be able to see what was going on in Birmingham this time last year. 

Oooh, another thought - this calendar could include a note of any festivals/events that are coming up; &quot;Put this date in your diaries&quot; kind of thing. I&#039;d find this quick overview of what&#039;s coming up pretty handy as there are times I forget what&#039;s going on ... 

Oooh, ooooh! There could be a subscription thing so it can then be read into iCal - I think that&#039;s possible?!

Okay, sorry, that&#039;s enough - better get back to work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@all Okay I&#039;m stumped. I think that we&#039;ve just got one of those weird browser issues pretty much _only_ in Internet Explorer 6 and I don&#039;t have a version that shows the problem so I can&#039;t test it.  

I&#039;ll find some time to fix the problem but I&#039;ve got to get back to some urgent work on something else now. 

Really sorry to the IE6 users amongst you who are seeing this right hand column problem. 

I&#039;ll try to get this fixed asap.

Any other problems/critique/ideas/suggestions just let us know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Browsershots.org can help this sort of cross browser testing (sure Stef knows about it, but it&#039;s handy tip for everyone). It&#039;s not quick as a number of computers running different operating systems really go to your site and submit screenshots &lt;a href=&quot;http://browsershots.org/http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;new  CriB design looks to be ok on most&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Russ L - Unfortunately this was a little on the rushed side, and I&#039;ve been testing on Windows 2003 server which looks like it&#039;s not perfect.

Huge apologies but this should be a quick fix!]]></description>
