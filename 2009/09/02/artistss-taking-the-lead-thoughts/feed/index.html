		<description><![CDATA[I am biased but 2 things.
1. Our idea &quot;Human Torch&quot; WT will involve the whole region.  It is a game/experience/art thing (sic).  The &#039;winning&#039; team will be one with the most people that contributes to the work, and come from as geographically wide area as possible.
We will have some &#039;static visualisations&#039; or artworks in physically locations, some of which will be Birmingham.
2. We hope our idea will lead to other works being generated, as the output we create will be open, machine readable, and produced under suitable Creative Commons licenses.

anyway.

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! Anyone who can spend a £500, 000 budget on a &#039;large grass covered hill&#039; is clever indeed... if only I&#039;d thought of that!!

And of course, an American composer is an obvious choice to represent the WMs! 

At least the other three could end in something other than a washout....]]></description>
