		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t be so surprised that amateurs might have access to the latest digital equipment. Plenty of people spend their own money on their hobbies, and you&#039;re forgetting students too, who often can borrow gear.

I&#039;m guessing that the &quot;no professionals&quot; rule is to avoid complaints from people who object to signing over unlimited publication rights to BCC, on any submitted images - not just those that are selected for a prize. This pretty much means you won&#039;t be able to sell that image again, and certainly not to any magazine that might ask for an exclusivity window. It&#039;s a pity that the publication plans aren&#039;t spelt out in more detail really (eg. &quot;All entries will be available on the website as screen-sized jpg images for no more than 3 months after the closing date. Winning entries will be required to grant print publication rights for our community newspaper.&quot;). The lack of clarity might make for shorter rules (arguably) but it should dissuade people, especially students who aspire to sell work, from entering.]]></description>
