		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jawj, we decided on Katie&#039;s design simply because it was the best! It is going to look great on a tee shirt and selling the t-shirts for charity is what it is all about. It is a simple design concept for a simple charity idea. I wasn&#039;t aware of the origins of the design but a homage / pastiche / nod to something else is all good with me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm... interesting: design and potential debate on validity of design wining such a competition. Now I must say the honesty on the origins is commendable and can see the work seems to have been done as a bit of and an experiment, but for it to win a design competition when it is a copy of another design? Maybe the other entries were rubbish and/or maybe the judges had no idea or its origination but I&#039;m not convinced. Yes all in the name of charity is good and I have no problem with the work being done as internal company development but in the public domain in this way is questionable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words, folks! 

I&#039;m hoping it&#039;ll help raise lots of money for Acorns - my dad has already told me he&#039;ll have a t-shirt, so there&#039;s one sold before it&#039;s even been made ;)

In response to John (and to repeat James), the ward map was based on the design of an Ork Posters map of Chicago, which is twinned with Brum (as mentioned in the post James has linked to above). So, yep, it looks like that on purpose!

I&#039;m just really pleased that something I enjoyed doing as a little experiment will, fingers crossed, help make a bit of cash for a good cause - as well as being highly educational ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s excellent. It&#039;s actually a list of electoral wards around Birmingham so even to a life-long Brummie like me some of the names are unfamiliar (Sutton Trinity?). It reminds me that area I grew up in (Ward End/Alum Rock/&lt;a href=&quot;http://billdargue.jimdo.com/placenames-gazetteer-a-to-y/places-s/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Saltley&lt;/a&gt;) doesn&#039;t even get a look in anymore. Although using wards is so much better than more recent inventions such as Eastside, Westside, Heartlands etc.

The version on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.birminghameconomy.org.uk/wards.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Birmingham Economy website&lt;/a&gt; is clickable so you can find out fascinating facts about each ward such as:
&quot;Shard End Ward is situated in the east of the city. It has a slightly older age profile than the City average. The percentage of ethnic minority residents is below the city average. Unemployment is above the city average.&quot; Or at least that&#039;s the kind of stuff I find fascinating.]]></description>
