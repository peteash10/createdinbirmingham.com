		<description><![CDATA[Harry - Thanks for the kind words, and yes a new banner is on it&#039;s way, just tinkering with it at the moment.

Joe - Please bear with me whist I sort these bits out! Dullness will be eradicated asap.

Carl - Welcome to CiB! I am glad you have been enjoying the blog, I will take a look at yours too.

Stef - *gulp* I hope you like the new look when it is all finished. It would be good to have a chat about updating all of those plugins and stuff as loads of them were not working so I disabled them for now. Any help would be very much appreciated. I will load a new favicon when I have made it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ All that hard work!  (I joke!)

Nice and simple :)

Not sure if you&#039;ve received my tweets but you&#039;ve lost the Microformats from the previous version and the Feedburner feed is no longer there, along with the HTML newsletter that gets sent out, and all the Geolocation header information isn&#039;t in there either.

Have a chat some time so I can fill you in on the hidden goodies of the previous version?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome website and blog.

Just surfing and caught a wave that led me to this infomative whirlpool of infomation. Infomative infomation? erm, I&#039;ve just thought, sometimes infomation isn&#039;t infomative so, yeah, infomative infomation...

Anyway, if you’ve got a second it’d be much appreciated if you could check out www.threescoblog.blogspot.com and let us know what you think.

Thanks.
