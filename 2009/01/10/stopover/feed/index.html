		<description><![CDATA[aha! that&#039;s my poster. 
I also lived at the Lab around 1973? i think. first in the rooms under the coffee bar and then in the blocked-off stairwell - an interesting shape! I remember Tony Jones, Pete, Terry Grimley, Ken Meharg and Bob, Neil Murray, Stuart Rogers et al.......it was a fun time. Did some cinema projection on the ancient old projectors, made costumes and worked with the Performance Group, and then i got into the Slade to do theatre design and moved to london. Happy memories.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really surprised you don&#039;t hear more about Birmingham Arts Lab, seems like it was a great art group. I&#039;ve been trying to do some research on it but keep hitting dead ends :-(]]></description>
