		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d also add that CiB was conceived to serve and monitor a pretty specific niche in the city. It&#039;s not intended to be read, or even heard of, by everyone. It&#039;s intended to strengthen the community within that niche and help them communicate. 

So, G, unless you&#039;re an artist, musician, etc or someone working in what&#039;s become known as &quot;the creative sector&quot; (horrible term I know) in Birmingham, that you&#039;ve not come across the blog before implies you have impeccable Interweb filters. Congratulations!

(Disclosure - I co-conceived the blog back in 2006)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[G. Baxter-Wright - CiB was only started in December 2006 and I&#039;m pleased to say that, although we have no budget for publicity, people in this city continue to discover this blog every day, largely by word of mouth.

Of course, you&#039;re absolutely correct to say that Melanie Phillips&#039; blog is hosted by the Spectator.  I described her as a &#039;a Daily Mail columnist&#039; respecting how she is described in the sidebar of that blog.

However, I appreciate there may be some confusion so I have amended my sentence from &#039;as I type this we’re in 2nd and a Daily Mail columnist is winning&#039; to &#039;as I type this we’re in 2nd and a Spectator-hosted blog is winning&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Came here to briefly read through your blog, as I had done with other uk blogs.

meant to be for a few seconds, but kept on reading.

I like it, you&#039;ve got my vote.

&#060;also voted for best Liberal blog, which IMO is Shakesville here;

But some votes are needed.
Thanks]]></description>
