		<description><![CDATA[First of all, congratulations on the Best UK Blog Award.  I voted for Melanie Phillips, but I&#039;m happy for you.  Winning the Best UK Blog Award makes you one of my regular reads for at least the next year.

While I grew up in the US, I spent a year in Birmingham in 1965, where I attended Hallfield School.  So I have a place in my heart for Birmingham.

I hope CiB will link up its blog posts and Twitter updates.  There are a lot of clever and nice people on Twitter who have some good ideas as to how to use social media.]]></description>
