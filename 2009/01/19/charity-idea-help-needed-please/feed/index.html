		<description><![CDATA[If this is a charity project, why not involving suppliers too? I mean:  those who sell &#038; print t-shirts and bags, mugs, whatever could also be interested in getting involved. This way would be easier for instance, to get the first run, and with that paying for the second one. They can help, for saying something, paying for the delivery costs or just delivering themselves at no cost.
It&#039;s just an idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like this idea. It&#039;d be great if each run of products was unique in some way e.g. for the bags, every time a new image is used so too is a new type of bag]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You might want to check out Zazzle.  They are print on demand and recently launched a UK site.  It&#039;s similar to Cafe Press but most of the products are produced within 24 hours.  And I know they have a non profit division called Zazzle Giving.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Acorns would be a good one as like many charities at the moment, they have a deficit in the balance sheet.
I&#039;ve got lots of contacts with the charity and would be happy to forward them. They have a really good team and I&#039;m sure they could help market/offer advice with the project.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no idea about their capacity to deliver what people would want, but Jericho Print - http://www.jcp.org.uk - is a social enterprise based in Balsall Heath.  Could be an excellent way of producing printed goods locally as well as supporting another worthwhile project?]]></description>
