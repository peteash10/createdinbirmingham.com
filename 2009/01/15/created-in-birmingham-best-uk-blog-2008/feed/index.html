		<description><![CDATA[Very big congrats to the CIB team, and fantasic to have the other Birmingham based blogs in the running too. I am a Welsh outsider, but have lived in Brum for a few years now and this really impacts on the sense of a creative community, something to be very proud of! 
Well done!
Should we have a party?]]></description>

Thanks also must go to fellow nominee Pete Ashton who gracefully told all and sundry to vote for CIB rather than himself. Also to everyone who facebooked, twittered and blogged about voting for us.
