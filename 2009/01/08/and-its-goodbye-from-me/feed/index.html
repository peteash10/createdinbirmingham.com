		<description><![CDATA[Chris, you&#039;ve done a really fantastic job since you took up the reins - you really tapped into the essence of CiB and, whilst keeping this up, made it your own, too. You will be missed lots, lovey.

But, I&#039;m very much looking forward to seeing Kate take up the baton, get her hands mucky and make it her own! This is the beauty of how it&#039;s been handled since its creation - the fact that it doesn&#039;t &#039;belong&#039; to one person adds to the mix and keeps it lovely and noisy.

Au revoir Chris, and welcome Kate!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for that Chris! I still think we should do a Doctor Who style regeneration video, although I am not as exciting as a new Doctor obviously. I hope to do as good a job as Chris and the rest of the authors have and I will properly introduce myself very soon. Jon - I am hoping to come along next Wed so see you then!]]></description>
