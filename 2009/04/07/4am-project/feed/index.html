		<description><![CDATA[I was so excited to take part in this!  It&#039;s amazing how peaceful and serene everything is at 4am.  I live in Monterey, California and in April, it&#039;s quite chilly.  But that didn&#039;t stop my husband and I from roaming around and finding interesting things to take pics of.  What was really cool was going back out during the day and seeing just how different those same things look in the sunlight.

Thanks for the experience!

		<description><![CDATA[Hello all,

I went along to the Birmingham 4am project. It was very interesting to see the world at that hour and the little pockets of urban life, either deadly quiet or manic trade. Great to meet other photographers and good to see what they produced on Flickr. And what about those breakfasts at the Market... Awesome! Cheers Guys good to meet a few of you.
