		<description><![CDATA[I volunteered last year at the Supersonic Festival and I had a blast!  Seriously, don&#039;t just think it is for entry level type experience.  Although I have a busy day job at Fierce and lost to do with Creative Republic it was really great to participate in an event I was not running.  I looked after the tea stall, amongst other things.  What a hoot!  The Supersonic crowd like their tea.  Which is wierd coz I had just assumed from the look of some of the scarier highly tattooed, hightly pierced lot that they&#039;d mainly like warm blood... Just goes to show you should never judge by appearances!  

Seriously though, there&#039;s lots of scope for skills and talents in all areas and even if this is not your favourite sort of music there is loads to see and do as well as bands... film, design and a great great vibe.

See you there!  I&#039;ll be the one in the apron.]]></description>
