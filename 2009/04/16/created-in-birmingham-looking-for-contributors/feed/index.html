		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Richard, I would love for you to contribute something and hear about your experiences. 

Timmy - No, no fee for contributors, just the opportunity to get involved. I will speak about this in the next few weeks, but basically, funding for CiB is coming to an end and will have to rely on a bit of advertising revenue and a whole lotta goodwill from myself and other contributors. Hope that explains all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Contibute..yes I&#039;d love to. I&#039;ll send more details shortly but have been involved in the Creative Sector
in Birmingham since I graduated in 1986 and have been based at The Custard Factory for literally 100&#039;s of years.
So long in fact I&#039;m actually a veteran!
I photograph and have exhibited and toured a show.]]></description>
