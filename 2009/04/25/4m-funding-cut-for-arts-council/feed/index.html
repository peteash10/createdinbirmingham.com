		<description><![CDATA[&#039;An economic recession never stopped an eccentric&#039; is the current editorial in The Eccentric City newspaper K/s - the cockerel that beareth. Indeed, I went on to suggest that this is also associated with a cultural recession that has, in many ways, been on-going for many years. I don&#039;t believe that financial aid restricts creativity. In my opinion, some of the best work that I have seen, that is fresh, highly original and at odds with my surroundings and conditions, have largely not been directly effected by arts subsidy. Obviously, this is a personal &#039;taste&#039;, and hence why I enjoy bringing individuals together in a newspaper tabloid format.]]></description>
