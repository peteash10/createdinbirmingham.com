		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, looks alright to me. 20% more space doesn&#039;t sound a lot but one of the issues with the current building isn&#039;t really lack of space as such but poor use of space in the design.

As for Rep off-site stuff, I&#039;m under the impression that they&#039;re not actually going off site and will remain open. Apparently they&#039;re convinced there won&#039;t be any sound issues from demolition/construction work, though this may be out of date info.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Why didn’t BCC appoint a UK based architect?&quot;

Because the current system does not allow employment based on nationality, that would contravene UK and EU laws. If we don&#039;t like that system then we need to change it. I personally agree with it, because the Old Library building, built by a local architect, is one of the most dreadful buildings I have ever seen in my life. Local isn&#039;t always good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks nice outside.  20% bigger than old one doesn&#039;t sound like an adequately bigger library to keep up with growth of material we hope to have in it.  Main beef is what is happening inside the library.  I can see IT can have a big impact to increase accessibility to material, however recent staff cuts, employment freezes and so on in library services are worrying.  Librarians, archivists, other library employees are key to making sure the library will work, and equality of access a reality.  Also, if fancy IT stuff is not properly implemented, administered, maintained (already computer repairs in central library stretched), then could end up with more problems and less access, and all those fabulous librarians and their specialist knowledge gone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Procurement is the nut to crack now I think. In two ways: how can Birmingham&#039;s creative community contribute their knowledge so that the kind of spaces that would attract them into the new library get created and therefore the right infrastructure gets procured? And how can companies line themselves up as potential suppliers to the city for this and other projects. 

The creative community could use the library project to begin a dialogue with procurement. For my part I&#039;m trying to introduce BCC procurement to the wonders of social media to get the conversation started.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new design looks exciting, cycling past the site today I could already imagine it there, bring it on. I especially like the look of the hole in Centenary Square.

As for the old library, I&#039;m too new to Birmingham to remember how it was when that black and white photograph was taken, but it looks far better then, in its austere emptiness than it does now with all the bars and restaurants Etc., but then bleak and austere does it for me and not most folk.

I&#039;m interested to know where Birmingham Rep will visit during its &#039;Off site&#039; period.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why didn&#039;t BCC appoint a UK based architect?  Because it was an international competition, carried out under procurement regulations, and a Dutch company won.  

Dont&#039; get me wrong, I think it would have been wonderful if an Birmingham based company had got it - but they didn&#039;t.  But now this (Dutch)firm will open a base in Brum and employ local architects.  

And let&#039;s not forget that our local architects, and any UK firms, are free to compete for the contract to design Dutch libraries - or any library or building in any EU country.  That&#039;s how the EU works.

Norman Foster and partners is an architecture practice of international reknown - when he designed Hong Kong airport I don&#039;t think we jumped up and down saying &quot;It&#039;s a shame they didn&#039;t use local architects&quot;.  When Frank Geary did the Guggenhiem in Bilbao everyone thought it was a coup for Bilbao.

Let&#039;s instead take this as a rallying call for local architects to compete on the world stage - I can&#039;t wait for the day that you report on this blog that some of our fantastic design talent, like Glenn Howells, has won the opportunity to design a major building in a city elsewhere in the world.]]></description>
