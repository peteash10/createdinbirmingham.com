		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Chris, I didn&#039;t necessarily take the post to be critical of the payout in itself, but I just wanted to set the scant information in a bit of context.  And yes, the comparison with lawyers is on one level, quite pointless:  there are lots of people (including chief executives of arts funding bodies) who are paid more than artists and arts organisation executives.

The Arts Council re-organisation is reputedly a response to a call to save 15% of its operating costs while not touching the grants.  You&#039;ve got to guess that the on-costs of downsizing have been factored into this equation. (Please tell me that I didn&#039;t just type &quot;on-costs&quot; and &quot;downsize&quot; in one sentence.  I better get back to the Twitpanto instead).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Careful about mentioning FOIs, there are people in this office who send them for fun.

This wasn&#039;t intended to be a critical post necessarily, so I wouldn&#039;t describe it as &#039;armed&#039; in any way. Pushed for an opinion then, for the reasons you point out, the amount is probably fair enough (although comparisons with lawyers&#039; remuneration is going to skew things). I&#039;m guessing that overall the cost will be counterbalanced by savings anyway.

However, it&#039;s an interesting tidbit that&#039;s come out about a restructure that&#039;s yielded precious little official info (that I&#039;ve seen).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can we put this in some perspective?

Sally Luton has worked as a civil servant for 23 years and all that time enjoyed a pension plan as all civil servants do.  

Her salary, as the head of an organisation that has a - what £50million turnover? - is totally par for the course.  In fact compared to a senior role at BCC  (say, Clive Dutton at the City) it&#039;s my guess that it&#039;s on the low side.  A senior NHS manager would certainly be on that type of money.  

I understand that sounds like a lot of money in terms of what artists are paid, but that&#039;s not quite the point is it?

Any civil servant, having worked for 23 years and now entitled to draw a pension, a civil servants index linked pension is about that much.  She&#039;s not on any special deal.  If you don&#039;t like your taxes being spent in that way you perhaps should look further afield than the Arts Council:  it&#039;s happening all over.

And it&#039;s my understanding that Sally, along with a heap of other Arts Council staff, is being made redundant, so is entitled to a lump sum.  Having been there so long even the statutory amount is likely to be large and this has doubtless had some enhancement.  That&#039;s not unprecedented either.

By way of contrast, an associate solicitor (not a partner) at a regional law firm is probably making at least £80K - more in some cases.  When I left the law six years ago, NEWLY QUALIFIED lawyers were starting on £90K in certain US law firms.

If we are going to comment about this award to this person do you think we should be doing FOI requests to a variety of public servants so that we are judging the figures in some context?

It&#039;s very easy to look at a round sum and make a judgment about it.  (You could as easily look at RFO grants and wonder what people do with &quot;all that money&quot;).  

The message is simple:  if you want a big pay out before you retire, be a civil servant and work somewhere for 23 years.  I for one have never fancied that - and I give up my right to an index linked pension as a result.

Should artists have pensions and bonuses?  Of course, but be aware that choices like that have their consequences too.

If we&#039;re going to have a debate about the relative values of a society that pays bureaucrats in the arts world more than artists we should be armed with more than a one paragraph parliamentary answer reported in the Express and Star.]]></description>
