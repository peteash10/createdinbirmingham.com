But it has to work the other way as well Jake. No point in having a system that positions ‘high’ (subsidised) culture against ‘low’ (non-subsidised) culture. Those who are off to see a bit of Operatic Otello in a Digbeth warehouse next week should get free tickets to Snow White on Ice at the Alex next year.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Dave&lt;/cite&gt;

Agreed. My examples pointed to a trading up from &#039;low&#039; to &#039;high&#039; brow, but I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s what I really intended. The main thing is to convert people who attend something once or twice a year to attending three times a year (or more). I think that pairing could be between obvious crowd-pleasers and less obvious ones though.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What gets me is that ‘going out and having a good time’ should be considered such a hard thing to sell to people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Chris&lt;/cite&gt;

Well, you are competing against &#039;staying in and being miserable&#039;. 

I&#039;m not going to comment on Scene Central, because it might come across as sour grapes.]]></description>

I think the good folk of the Black Country would welcome &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=theatres+west+midlands&#038;sll=52.543373,-1.963806&#038;sspn=0.214223,0.571289&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;hq=theatres&#038;hnear=West+Midlands,+United+Kingdom&#038;t=h&#038;z=10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some facilities&lt;/a&gt; rather than a campaign aimed at telling them the cultural experiences they value, that makes meaning for them are somehow second rate. I thought Postmodernism dealt with all this?

NB: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esd.org.uk/Solutions4Inclusion/ProjectsByIndicators.aspx?NI=11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NI11 = &#039;The percentage of the adult population in a local area that have engaged in the arts at least three times in the past 12 months.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Going after semi-receptive audiences seems like a good move and yes, the web stuff seems ill-conceived at this stage - I&#039;m still not sold on the concept/execution of Scene Central and that was being talked up as being the main web presence for the West Mids. 

What gets me is that &#039;going out and having a good time&#039; should be considered such a hard thing to sell to people. After all, this lot - http://thefuntheory.com/ - can apparently make walking up stairs and using bins seem fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Other positives include a ruthless target-driven focus on semi-receptive audiences via mainstream media. Less good: a &#039;one stop shop&#039; website featuring &#039;themed lounges that allow the user to enter a virtual arts world&#039;. I don&#039;t see how the initial objective naturally leads to that method.

My idea? Package up arts experiences in threes like Collateralised Debt Obligations. If you want to see A Christmas Carol and We Will Rock You, you are forced to sit through Katya Kabanova too. Either by law [joke], or via clever pricing incentives. A website that did that might be quite interesting...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s great that there&#039;s a real determination to make it happen, and I think it&#039;s a smart move regionally to focus on the Black Country. But a little part of me dies when I hear that the solution is another logo on the flyers and another website. Is this not the type of thinking that&#039;s been driving failure to engage these past three years? Even &#039;Hello Art&#039;, the speech bubble device and the crazy web 2.0 UGC holding site feels like rehashing the same old stuff for the same old people.]]></description>
