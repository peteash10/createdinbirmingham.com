		<description><![CDATA[The idea of a film centre got rolled into the consultancy as well - or so it was stated at the time. Am slightly confused at the figures. Is it £180,000 for the consultancy and then a separate £200,000 to stage some art in Eastside? Or a total of £380,000 for the consultancy. Pricey whichever way the figures are worked.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris,

I was at the Art of Ideas talk and it stimulated a lot of debate about if/what a MOCA for Birmingham should be... hence the feasibility study.

I have talked to Jonathan Watkins about this, and it seems there will be some public consultation meetings held soon to engage a wider public debate about the options available. In the meantime I think its a little early to say things are fixed on if/what it will be, let alone where it will be sited...
