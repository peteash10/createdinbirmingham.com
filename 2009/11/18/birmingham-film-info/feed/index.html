		<description><![CDATA[Hi 

Thought I&#039;d draw attention to a proposal from Brendan O&#039;Neill for an Irish Film Festival in Bham.  Still inplanning stages by the looks of things but could be interesting:

http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=179666013210

Here&#039;s the blurb from Brendan on the Facebook page:

A film festival devoted to film from or about Ireland or with an identifiable Irish interest/connection.

I want to showcase Irish culture and life through the medium of film and also show that there is a lot more to Irish culture than the prevailing image of a big parade one day each year where everybody gets drunk!

A film festival would be a good start but I would like to grow it into an Irish Culture week which would include a Digbeth based music festival music &quot;Jigbeth&quot; plus simultaneous theatre, art and photography exhibitions throughout the city.]]></description>
