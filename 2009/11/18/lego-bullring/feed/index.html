		<description><![CDATA[The Stan&#039;s Cafe pitch for the Arts Council&#039;s Cultural Olympiad project &quot;Artists Taking The Lead&quot; was to work with architects and school kids from around Birmingham building a ridiculously enormous cathedral out of Lego.

We were inspired by an exercise in which the City Council asked us what made a great international city and, thinking of Barcelona, I rather facetiously said &quot;a half finished Cathedral&quot; and was never able to shift the idea that we should half build a cathedral in Birmingham.

Unfortunately days before the deadline James May from Top Gear launched his life-size lego house project and I&#039;m convinced that is the only reason why the region now has a large Lady Godiva parade in Coventry to lookforward to (obviously it&#039;s not but it helps my pride to think of it like this).]]></description>
