		<description><![CDATA[They only showed an extract at the Brighton show though - this will be the full-blown thing. There may even be condiments.

True on the price thing generally - maybe it&#039;s just that it&#039;s more than a company like Kindle would ordinarily charge, although I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m basing that on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was going to respond and say: &quot;Tickets are £16-£19. I think that&#039;s fairly good value for theatre isn&#039;t it? In fact, it seems a bit cheap given it sounds like it comes with chicken in a basket. Have you seen how much it is to go to the RSC? (answer: lots).&quot;

But then I noticed it only cost &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ents24.com/web/event/1794654/Eat_Your_Heart_Out.html?show=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;£7 to go see it in Brighton&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe they got smaller portions.]]></description>
