		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s just depressing. It&#039;s still going on too. Just take the front of the old Central TV building on Broad Street that&#039;s recently been torn down, presumably to make room for another car park or, I know, let&#039;s have some more empty offices eh? I suggest that those responsible be tried for crimes against Birmingham&#039;s architectural heritage. I&#039;m amazed the Town Hall survived.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s obscene. Presumably they dismantled the beautiful original building brick-by-brick and it&#039;s in storage somewhere waiting for the upside-down concrete wedding cake to be demolished?

Thanks Chris, I have to see these films.]]></description>
