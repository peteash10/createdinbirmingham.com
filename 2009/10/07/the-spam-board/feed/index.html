		<description><![CDATA[Well, that&#039;s one way of looking at it I suppose. On the other hand what&#039;s being taken away here? What&#039;s anyone being asked to pay? How is this anything other than an added extra?

As far as marginalising goes, I know more people in Birmingham who use FB (shonky as it can be) on a daily basis than read/subscribe to arts &amp; culture blogs. If CiB was going Facebook only then I&#039;d take your point, but this is a nice demonstration that people can still have a discussion on the site itself

Interested by the &#039;even further&#039; though and by any suggestions you&#039;ve got for improving CiB.]]></description>
