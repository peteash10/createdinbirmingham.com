		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris

Thanks for flagging this up! We have 11 open rehearsals around the region with a good proportion of them in Brum. We really want to get people to try singing who would otherwise be a bit reluctant as people get so much out of it every week in these singing groups - a kick from the music, fun, new friends, health benefits. The choirs that are signed up are really varied so there should be something for a wide variety of tastes... Full details on www.singwm.com.

Anyone from CiB want to come along to a rehearsal and see how it goes for them :-)?
