		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s time for something like this again
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Arts_Lab

Nothing happened except at weekends, and not much happened then either, except that music was played, coloured lights were projected and people ate vegetables and brown rice and drank instant coffee.&quot;]]></description>
