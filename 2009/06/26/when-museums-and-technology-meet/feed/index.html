		<description><![CDATA[We are very pleased the website has received such enthusiastic and positive feedback already from so many different people, blogs, channels and organisations, we (the project team) are all very proud of the results of lots of hard work over a number of years.
I am very interested in the photograph mentioned by Roger Shannon, Roger, when you’ve time could you have a look for it and then contact me, or the BMAG Picture Library, we’d love to see it and maybe acquire a copy for the collection.

Thanks,
