		<description><![CDATA[Awh I&#039;m touched you&#039;ve mentioned me in that post Kate, thanks! I agree with the others, I&#039;ve really enjoyed CiB under your editorship- you&#039;ve done a great job and brought your own style and passion to the blog. Well done and good luck with the wedding planning!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I think you&#039;ve been a fab editor - engaging, interesting, enthusiastic … I could go on ;) I&#039;m looking forward to carrying on reading your stuff on Colour and your own blog too (hint, hint!) - and perhaps we&#039;ll actually meet in real life one day!

Thanks for making CiB yours during your stint as editor - can&#039;t wait to see how it morphs again under Adrienne&#039;s editorship.

PS It&#039;s Parry with an &#039;a&#039;!]]></description>
