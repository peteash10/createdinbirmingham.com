<p><a href="https://ikon-gallery.org/">Ikon</a> and <a href="http://www.birminghamcathedral.com/">Birmingham Cathedral</a> present a new site-specific work by Birmingham-born artist Roger Hiorns, <a title="https://ikon-gallery.org/event/untitled-a-retrospective-view-of-the-pathway/" href="https://ikon-gallery.org/event/untitled-a-retrospective-view-of-the-pathway/" target="_blank">Untitled (a retrospective view of the pathway), 2016</a></p>
<p>Working with the choir of St Philip’s Cathedral, Birmingham, the event sees choristers undertake Choral Evensong whilst lying on their backs on the floor, within the nave of the church, rather than standing to sing in stalls behind the altar. This will be a full service rather than a performance – led by The Very Revd Catherine Ogle, Dean of Birmingham, and directed by Canon Marcus Huxley – with the congregation seated in the aisles and galleries. The event raises important questions concerning the aesthetics of faith and worship in modern life; plays with perceptions of life and death and sleep and consciousness; and re-imagines an ancient ritual, part of an establishment that defines our society – all within sight of the Cathedral’s stained glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones depicting the Last Judgment.</p>
<p>Untitled (a retrospective view of the pathway) takes place from 5.30-6.30pm on Wednesday 15 June and Friday 17 June 2016. Places are free but should be booked.</p>

<p>On Saturday 11 June, Birmingham-based Czech artist Tereza Buskova will revitalise a very old English tradition and bring it back to the city. Working with the local community, she will reinterpret the custom of ‘<a href="https://clippingthechurch.wordpress.com/">Clipping the Church</a>’ in an event which will explore motherhood and investigate British identity through its traditions.</p>
<p>Derived from the Anglo-Saxon word ‘clyp-pan’ meaning ‘embrace’ or ‘clasp’, the ceremony is believed to have originated in the 16<sup>th</sup> Century. Clipping the Church took place once a year when young apprentices and women in service were allowed to visit their families. During the ceremony, the reunited families and local faithful would link hands to form an unbroken chain around the entire church. Facing out towards the world, members of this living circle would often sing hymns as they slowly moved around the symbol of their faith and belonging. Although there is evidence ceremonies took place in Birmingham, it is unknown where.</p>
<p>On 11 June this custom will be recreated with over one hundred locals at St Barnabas&#8217; Church in Erdington. Buskova will explore motherhood through live performance, music and ornate baked goods, which will be paraded and affixed to the church as decorations.</p>
<p>Just a few days before the EU referendum, this event will also invite reflection on how the meaning of ‘community’ has changed from the days when Clipping the Church involved the people of a single village.</p>
<p>Full details and times of the performance can be found <a href="https://clippingthechurch.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/clipping-the-church-11th-june/">here</a>. The finished film <em>Clipping the Church </em>(2016) will be debuted at Eastside Projects at an event exploring &#8216;<a href="http://eastsideprojects.org/events/current/">Motherhood, maternal and art</a>&#8216; on Thursday 21 July 2016</p>

<p>A new exhibition of original wall sculptures from <strong>French artist Frédéric Daty</strong> launches at <strong>Castle Fine Art</strong> <strong>in The Mailbox</strong> on Saturday 2<sup>nd</sup> April, with the artist in attendance from 1-4pm.</p>
<p>In his second ever UK solo show, <strong><em>‘Trinity’</em></strong> sees world-famous cities and iconic UK landmarks depicted in metal. Daty’s innovative sculptures strip these overrun spaces of living organisms, revealing only the structure; the city’s skeleton.</p>
<p>For the exhibition in Birmingham, Daty has created four bespoke wall sculptures inspired by the UK’s second city – <strong>The Mailbox</strong>, the<strong> Bullring Bull</strong>, <strong>The Cube</strong>, <strong>the Library of Birmingham</strong>, <strong>The Rotunda</strong> and the <strong>spaghetti junction</strong> all feature in the new pieces.</p>
<p>The artist – who was talent spotted by Birmingham based art publishers Washington Green in 2014 – uses layers of hand-cut steel sheets to create the sculptures, which are then polished with varnish and coloured tar. The individual elements stand away from the wall at varying angles and distances, creating a 3D wall sculpture.</p>
<p>The shadows cast on the wall behind create another dimension to Daty’s work. Although the metal itself is static, the surface and colour of the sculptures change in response to how they are lit, giving the impression that the work itself is also moving and evolving.</p>
<p><em>‘Trinity’</em> launches at Castle Fine Art, The Mailbox, Ground Floor, 5 Wharfside, Birmingham, B1 1RD on Saturday 2<sup>nd</sup> April. The exhibition will then run for a further week.</p>
