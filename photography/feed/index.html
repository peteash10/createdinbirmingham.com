				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that <a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Flatpack Film Festival</a> is ten. Spawned from short film nights at the Rainbow in Digbeth, the festival now takes over the city with screenings, performances, installations and happenings every year.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s festival kicks off slightly later than usual (19-24 April) and is a little shorter than previous editions. However, it will feature the same cinematic fun and games that is known and loved for.</p>
<p>A couple of this year&#8217;s highlights:</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/vampyr/" target="_blank">Vampyr</a> &#8211; One of cinema’s landmarks, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s mesmerising horror Vampyr (1932), accompanied live by four-piece multi-instrumentalists Minima and film pianist Stephen Horne.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/oh-dear-diary/" target="_blank">Oh Dear Diary</a> &#8211; Brace yourself for an evening of angst-ridden, cringe-inducing, revealing and often unintentionally hysterical real life stories, as a group of volunteers read aloud from their teenage diaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/pierre-bastien/" target="_blank">Pierre Bastien</a> &#8211; Textured looping soundscapes made from Meccano parts, motors, fans, and rattles + trumpet.A treat for the eyes and ears.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/sound-and-vision/" target="_blank">Sound and Vision </a>&#8211; A mesmerising live AV triple-bill using lamps, lenses, modified record players, looping records and found objects. Those taking an analogue approach to their craft on the night include Amsterdam-based duo <a href="http://www.opticalmachines.nl" target="_blank">Optical Machines</a>, sound artist <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a> and Berlin-based artist collective <a href="ttp://transforma.de" target="_blank">Transforma</a> with musician/composer PC NAKT.</p>
<p>The full programme will be online in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://soulcityarts.com/portfolio/the-new-hubb/" target="_blank">The Hubb</a> was a pioneering arts centre which was open from 2010-2013 in Sparkbrook. It hosted artists, academics and community activists from around the world, and provided a space for local communities to come together and be inspired by art and culture.</p>
<p>The Hubb closed its doors in the summer of 2013 as a result of a compulsory purchase order on the building. However, the team behind the centre have been working behind the scenes ever since to find a new building in the locality. Premises have been found, but they need help in order to renovate the space. They are currently crowdfunding in order to undertake the first phases of development which includes new flooring and lighting; repairing walls and ceilings; correcting pipework and electrics; plastering and painting.</p>

<p>Birmingham City Council is facing huge challenges with less money to spend on its services. This is a time of change and the council wants to hear your voice. If you value the cultural offer in this city you may like to go along to one of the consultations being held in each constituency, a list of which can be found [below]:</p></blockquote>

<p>Last week a new exhibition launched at <a href="http://grainphotographyhub.co.uk/portfolio-type/in-camera-mat-collishaw/">Library of Birmingham</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Library of Birmingham and GRAIN are proud to present an exhibition of new work by artist Mat Collishaw supported by the Arts Council of England. The exhibition is presented in parallel with a major survey of Collishaw’s work being shown at The New Art Gallery Walsall (25 September 2015 – 10 January 2016).</p>
<p>In Camera is an installation created around a series of 12 crime scene negatives made Birmingham City Police Force during the 1930s and 1940s. Collishaw discovered these uncatalogued images, made to provide evidence in alleged and actual crimes committed in the city, hidden amongst an archive of orphaned police negatives whilst exploring the Library’s internationally renowned photography collections during 2014.</p>
<p>Intermittent flash bulbs will expose the images printed in phosphorescent ink and incarcerated in translucent vitrines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swish! 18 September 2015 – 10 January 2016 at Library of Birmingham. More information on the <a href="http://grainphotographyhub.co.uk/portfolio-type/in-camera-mat-collishaw/">Grain website here</a>.</p>
