				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Guest post by <a href="http://inkygoodness.com/blog/news/glug-poster-competition-winner-announcement/">Lara Shingles / Inkygoodness</a>:</em></p>

<p><strong>After weeks of sifting through a dizzying collection of submissons, we’re delighted to announce the winners of <a href="http://www.inkygoodness.com">Inkygoodness</a> &amp; <a href="http://createdinbirmingham.com/">Created in Birmingham&#8217;s</a> Glug Birmingham Poster Competition – <a href="http://www.louisebyng.co.uk/">Louise Byng</a> and <a href="http://laurieramsell.co.uk/">Laurie Ramsell</a>.</strong></p>
<p>A fun, playful and inventive competition entry, the creative pair ticked all our boxes with their playful DIY aesthetic.<span id="more-15550"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>We received some fantastic entries, but Louise and Laurie’s design was unlike anything else! Their clever interpretation of the theme makes great use of the limited colour palette, whilst combining hand made and digital image-making to produce a fun and playful design that really stands out.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Lisa Hassell, Director of Inkygoodness</p>
<p>Louise and Laurie took inspiration from Birmingham’s cultural and economic landscape for their winning design: “How [Birmingham] looks now; what it is becoming known for; and how that may have shifted since the original crest was conceived. With start-up companies and innovative independents now a huge driver for the city’s contemporary status, says Louise.</p>
<blockquote><p>We approached the design as a collaborative project, recreating the City of Birmingham’s crest physically and applying its dual representation of arts and industry to the creative sector. Our reworked motif depicts creativity as a personal expression and philosophy, but also a trade and a craft – something that resonates with Birmingham’s values and rich history as a city.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-11-18-Glug-Brum-Competition-winners1-e1416353193774.jpg" alt="2014-11-18-Glug-Brum-Competition-winners1-e1416353193774" width="560" height="792" /></p>
<p>The assemblage itself is low-fi and involved bringing together cardboard, staples and paint into a photographic set-up, keeping much of the construction visible in order to share this with the audience, encouraging a playful DIY approach to design rather than hiding the process away.” continues Louise.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a lot of fun to make, and as artists in the early stages of our careers it’s great to be recognised by glug in our home city; to share our impression of Birmingham with a wider audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>The creative pair are now in the throes of preparing a short presentation to join our Glug speakers on stage to share the process behind creating their winning artwork. 2nd prize goes to illustrator William Wright who designed this snazzy pencil design. William receives a goodie bag of art prints and illustrated zines, plus a pair of tickets to attend Glug Brum on Thursday evening!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Will-Wright--610x877.jpg" alt="Will-Wright-" width="610" height="877" /></p>
<p>Our shortlist includes 23 artworks hand picked from our entries earlier this week. Selected exhibiting artists are (in no particular order): Ian Aparici, Scott Williams, Sophie Kozlowski, Adam Moore, Ngu Ngok Chin, James Baldry, Jenny Sjodin, Bethany Raistrick, Georgia Fenton, Chantal Caduff, Rhiannon Sanderson, Súa Agapé, Fiona Hall, Mouni Feddag, Katie Tomlinson, Lesley Imgart, Jimmy Rogers, Amy Kilner, Liam Anslow, Daniel O’Brien, Raj Dhunna, Nick Tyler, Adam Corns &amp; Graham Johnson.</p>
<p>Attendees will get the opportunity to pick up their favourite Glug Poster design as a limited edition print courtesy of our exhibition sponsors Ripe Digital – priced at £15 each.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank everyone for taking part in our first Glug Birmingham competition – we received over 100 entries and selecting our shortlist was a (fun) challenge. We hope you can join us on Thursday evening.</p>
