<blockquote><p>In the lead up to his solo exhibition in London I decided to explore the deeper themes of painter Dean Melbourne in a short documentary.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known Dean for nearly 10 years, he used to be my art teacher at College and even after I left we somehow managed to keep bumping in to each other. In the more recent years our meetings led to a strong collaborative formation and ultimately inspired me to capture his art through a lens.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In June artist <a href="http://terezabuskova.com/" target="_blank">Tereza Buskova</a> will revive a 16th Century English tradition at a Church in Erdington; and she needs your help.</p>
<p><a href="https://clippingthechurch.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Clipping the Church</a> took place once a year when young apprentices and women in service were allowed to visit their families and their ‘mother’ church. Derived from the Anglo-Saxon word ‘clyp-pan’ meaning ‘embrace’ or ‘clasp’, the ceremony is often associated with Mothering Sunday. Church-goers would join hands and move around the outside of the church in an unbroken ring, often singing a traditional hymn. Although there is evidence that the ceremonies took place in Birmingham, it is unknown where.</p>
<p>In her take on the Clipping the Church ceremony, Tereza will explore the tradition in a new performance and video work exploring motherhood, the meaning of rituals, family ties and relationships with the local community. As part of the ceremony baked goods will be paraded. She is asking people to make salt dough decorations for the performance at workshops in the run up to the event. Try your hand at making beautiful traditional Eastern European plaited doughs, or express what motherhood means to you by using only flour, water and salt &#8211; and see them in the final performance and film.</p>
<p>Workshops take place on the following dates:</p>
<p>Saturday 19 March 2016, 11am-1.30pm &#8211; <a href="http://www.kingstandingfoodcommunity.co.uk" target="_blank">Kingstanding Food Community.</a></p>
<p>Saturday 30 April 2016, 11am-1pm &#8211; <a href="http://www.loafonline.co.uk" target="_blank">Loaf Bakery and Cookery School,</a> Stirchley.</p>
<p>Saturday 14 May 2016, 2.30pm (then a gathering with the artist, films screening + food and drink from 5pm).- <a href="http://www.stbarnabaserdington.org.uk" target="_blank">St Barnabas’ Church</a>, High Street, Birmingham. B23 6SY</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that <a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Flatpack Film Festival</a> is ten. Spawned from short film nights at the Rainbow in Digbeth, the festival now takes over the city with screenings, performances, installations and happenings every year.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s festival kicks off slightly later than usual (19-24 April) and is a little shorter than previous editions. However, it will feature the same cinematic fun and games that is known and loved for.</p>
<p>A couple of this year&#8217;s highlights:</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/vampyr/" target="_blank">Vampyr</a> &#8211; One of cinema’s landmarks, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s mesmerising horror Vampyr (1932), accompanied live by four-piece multi-instrumentalists Minima and film pianist Stephen Horne.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/oh-dear-diary/" target="_blank">Oh Dear Diary</a> &#8211; Brace yourself for an evening of angst-ridden, cringe-inducing, revealing and often unintentionally hysterical real life stories, as a group of volunteers read aloud from their teenage diaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/pierre-bastien/" target="_blank">Pierre Bastien</a> &#8211; Textured looping soundscapes made from Meccano parts, motors, fans, and rattles + trumpet.A treat for the eyes and ears.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/sound-and-vision/" target="_blank">Sound and Vision </a>&#8211; A mesmerising live AV triple-bill using lamps, lenses, modified record players, looping records and found objects. Those taking an analogue approach to their craft on the night include Amsterdam-based duo <a href="http://www.opticalmachines.nl" target="_blank">Optical Machines</a>, sound artist <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a> and Berlin-based artist collective <a href="ttp://transforma.de" target="_blank">Transforma</a> with musician/composer PC NAKT.</p>
<p>The full programme will be online in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>As part of <a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/">Flatpack</a>’s ongoing ‘Celluloid City’ season, this weekend there will be a programme of talks and screenings at mac birmingham that will explore the changing face of film as we shift from analogue to digital.</p>
<p>Events include a look behind the scenes of the wonderful <a href="http://macbirmingham.co.uk/exhibition/steenbeckett/">Steenbeckett</a> installation in the first floor gallery; a talk on the challenges of maintaining celluloid work in a digital world; Phil Fawkes, a projectionist from the late 1930s until only seven years ago reflects on the changes in film and a life in projection, and the University of Warwick’s Film and Television Department will be sharing their three year research project looking at the changing role of the projectionist (from fairground showmen to projection mapping). If you&#8217;d like to get a bit more hands on, you will be able to make your own animations by drawing directly onto 16mm film, and there will also be an opportunity to show your own film reels that may have been getting dusty in your loft.</p>
