		<description><![CDATA[Hello James and Jane,

Yes, it was intentional:

&quot;‘The Magic City’ is borrowed from a proposed artwork by BAZ, inspired by the sign that originally welcomed visitors to Birmingham, Alabama, USA. BAZ want to build a new version of the sign next to the planned hi-speed rail station destined for Eastside, Birmingham, UK. BAZ believe everything Birmingham does is magic.&quot;

...from the Liverpool Biennial website (link in the post)

Hope that clears it up!

		<description><![CDATA[Just wondering why the exhibition organisers chose to use an image of Terminal Station and Subway in Birmingham Alabama to promote this show? Was it incompetence or maybe just driven by a freudian slip and subconscious desire?]]></description>
