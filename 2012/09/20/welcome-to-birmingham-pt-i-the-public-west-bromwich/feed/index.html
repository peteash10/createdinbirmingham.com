		<description><![CDATA[Hey Daniel
As someone who is movinh to Birmigham soon, I actually appreciate any locations near birmingham being mentioned in this series too (because i&#039;m actually moving to redditch which is outside of birmingham but i&#039;d like to know of any arts venues near or in the city) so please don&#039;t stop mentioning areas near Birmingham that you think may be relevant!
 Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Welcome to Birmingham articles are to introduce Birmingham and the surrounding areas to newcomers. I felt The Public was quite a relevant place for people looking to become involved in the art scene in this area.

Rest assured though that the upcoming articles in this series will be very much Birmingham centric.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love The Public. When I go there, it makes me feel creative, which as a nation, we need to be in the 21st century.

We ran an event here last year and the space we hired was inspiring. Colourful, modern, open plan and a healthy, tasty buffet, all conducive to creative thinking.

I work with a team who have offices in the building and who are about to host an exhibition in the reception area. They, too, throw flowers at The Public. It&#039;s been a slow burn for some, but, for me, it&#039;s what UK in the 21st century needs more of.]]></description>
