		<description><![CDATA[I saw Cinderella on Saturday night. I don&#039;t have much experience of ballet, I thought myself more of a theatre guy, but I have to say that the performance really challenged my assumptions of what ballet is and can be like. The performance was light, fun, engaging and the sets were beautiful. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone - particularly if you don&#039;t usually go to see ballet. Well done BRB!]]></description>
