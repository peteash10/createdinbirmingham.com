		<description><![CDATA[Come and see us at Eastside Projects, then take a wander to Grand Union and The Lombard Method then round it off at Edible Eastside. And there are a few new spaces opening up at the moment - Stryx is setting up in Minerva Works, A3 project space is in development and MSFAC are about to start a 12 month residency at The Edge - Friction Arts Space. All within ten minutes slow saunter of the Bullring. You can also find things happening occasionally at The Wig in Ladywood - currently a nice little show by a group of students from the School of Art.]]></description>
