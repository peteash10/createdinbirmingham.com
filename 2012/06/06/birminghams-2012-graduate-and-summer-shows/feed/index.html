		<description><![CDATA[Dear Chris,
many thanks for featuring a link to Outline on your site. Outline is the art and design department at Birmingham Met College, Outline is based in Sutton Coldfield. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me if there are any activities that you got see us and our students getting involved with, thanks. 
Can I make you aware of our current initiative called &quot;City of 1000 stories&quot;, which can be found here: http://cityof1000stories.blogspot.co.uk/, which is an initiative by Outline to engage with a wide, local audience to record their stories and tails.
Take care,
Tj]]></description>
