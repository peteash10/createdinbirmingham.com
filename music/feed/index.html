				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that <a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/" target="_blank">Flatpack Film Festival</a> is ten. Spawned from short film nights at the Rainbow in Digbeth, the festival now takes over the city with screenings, performances, installations and happenings every year.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s festival kicks off slightly later than usual (19-24 April) and is a little shorter than previous editions. However, it will feature the same cinematic fun and games that is known and loved for.</p>
<p>A couple of this year&#8217;s highlights:</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/vampyr/" target="_blank">Vampyr</a> &#8211; One of cinema’s landmarks, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s mesmerising horror Vampyr (1932), accompanied live by four-piece multi-instrumentalists Minima and film pianist Stephen Horne.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/oh-dear-diary/" target="_blank">Oh Dear Diary</a> &#8211; Brace yourself for an evening of angst-ridden, cringe-inducing, revealing and often unintentionally hysterical real life stories, as a group of volunteers read aloud from their teenage diaries.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/pierre-bastien/" target="_blank">Pierre Bastien</a> &#8211; Textured looping soundscapes made from Meccano parts, motors, fans, and rattles + trumpet.A treat for the eyes and ears.</p>
<p><a href="http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/sound-and-vision/" target="_blank">Sound and Vision </a>&#8211; A mesmerising live AV triple-bill using lamps, lenses, modified record players, looping records and found objects. Those taking an analogue approach to their craft on the night include Amsterdam-based duo <a href="http://www.opticalmachines.nl" target="_blank">Optical Machines</a>, sound artist <a href="http://grahamdunning.com/" target="_blank">Graham Dunning</a> and Berlin-based artist collective <a href="ttp://transforma.de" target="_blank">Transforma</a> with musician/composer PC NAKT.</p>
<p>The full programme will be online in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Ever been to an opera? I have to admit, I haven&#8217;t. Considering I live in a city that has a wonderful opera company that successfully turns the art form on its head (that involves the local community to a great extent, and has even put on a production that involved a string quartet <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/23/karlheinz-stockhausen-mittwoch-aus-licht-birmingham" target="_blank">flying around in helicopters)</a>, it&#8217;s about time I got round to seeing one of <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk" target="_blank">Birmingham Opera Company</a>&#8216;s productions.</p>
<p>Their next production is Henry Purcell’s &#8216;Dido and Aeneas&#8217;. Based on Book IV of Virgil&#8217;s &#8216;Aeneid&#8217;, the opera recounts the love of Dido, Queen of Carthage, for the Trojan hero Aeneas, and her despair when he abandons her. The opera was first performed in 1689.</p>
<p>&#8216;Dido and Aeneas&#8217; runs from 18-23 March in a top secret Birmingham location. Tickets are only a fiver and can be bought <a href="http://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Made by British-Chinese artist Aowen Jin and commissioned by Birmingham Hippodrome CREATIVE, the piece is a constantly changing public artwork, which the spectator can alter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Watch as the fibre optics react differently to each spectator, and take control of the entire field by interacting with it on Twitter&#8230;. Specially designed modules containing Raspberry Pis control thousands of LEDS, each featuring 9,000 colour variations. The lights constantly learn from their surroundings, adjusting intelligently to make sure that no two experiences with the artwork are ever the same.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://soulcityarts.com/portfolio/the-new-hubb/" target="_blank">The Hubb</a> was a pioneering arts centre which was open from 2010-2013 in Sparkbrook. It hosted artists, academics and community activists from around the world, and provided a space for local communities to come together and be inspired by art and culture.</p>
<p>The Hubb closed its doors in the summer of 2013 as a result of a compulsory purchase order on the building. However, the team behind the centre have been working behind the scenes ever since to find a new building in the locality. Premises have been found, but they need help in order to renovate the space. They are currently crowdfunding in order to undertake the first phases of development which includes new flooring and lighting; repairing walls and ceilings; correcting pipework and electrics; plastering and painting.</p>
<p>Donations can be made <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/soul-city-arts-452494">here</a>.</p>
