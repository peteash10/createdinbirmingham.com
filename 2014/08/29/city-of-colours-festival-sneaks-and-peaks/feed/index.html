		<description><![CDATA[Good day! This is kind of off topic but I need some advice from an established blog.

Is it hard to set up your own blog? I&#039;m not very techincal but I 
can figure things out pretty quick. I&#039;m thinking about setting up my own but I&#039;m 
not sure where to start. Do you have any points or suggestions?
Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We absolutely love your blog and find nearly all of your post&#039;s to be just what I&#039;m looking 
for. can you offer guest writers to write content for yourself?
I wouldn&#039;t mind composing a post or elaborating on many of the subjects you write with regards to here.

Again, awesome web log!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love the article, especially the sneaks and peaks. Proves to be a great weekend for Digbeth, already a trendy and happening place. 
Here&#039;s a press release I found about one of the office buildings being used for artwork, it&#039;s Digbeth Court on the A45
