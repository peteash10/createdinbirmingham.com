		<description><![CDATA[Hey superb blog! Does running a blog similar to this require a large amount of work?

I have very little expertise in programming but I had been hoping to start my own blog in the near future.

Anyway, should you have any recommendations or tips for new blog owners please share.
I understand this is off topic however I simply needed to ask.
Kudos!]]></description>
