		<description><![CDATA[Hey,

I happened to walk past on Saturday and I have to say I thought it was brilliant!  I was immediately greeted by smiling and friendly faces, who knew exactly what they were talking about! 

I&#039;m new to the CiB website etc so I was really pleased to hear that it&#039;s fairly easy for me to sell via your shop as well! 

Just thought I would leave some kind words as I was so impressed :)
