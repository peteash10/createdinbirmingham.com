		<description><![CDATA[At last. All the arts stuff is of course great but MAC&#039;s primary function, as any parent will tell you, is a place to get a coffee or a beer on a Sunday afternoon as the kids run riot in the park. Divorced and non-divorced dads of south Birmingham rejoice!

&quot;A new anthem developed in celebration of mac’s re-opening&quot;. Thought makes me shudder a bit. No-one ever believes me but when the Metro tram line opened a song was also commissioned to celebrate that but was quietly shelved in the run up to the opening. 

Of course, I&#039;m also eager to find out what its cinema programming policy will be. Great to have a second arts/indie screen back in use.]]></description>
