		<description><![CDATA[Ah, ta for the Birmingham Music questionnaires link - I&#039;ve not been very on top of my RSS reader recently and hadn&#039;t seen them.

Russ - yeah, that&#039;s pretty much the point. I think the way some people talk about music puts others (with a lot of good experience and useful stuff to say) right off. Using the &#039;i&#039; word is part of that. But then I guess there&#039;s a risk of spending too long fannying around trying to find a form of words/drawing arbitrary lines that offend no-one rather than doing much of any practical use - music politics, eh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you brought this up on CiB Chris. It&#039;s a really complex issue and while I don&#039;t feel informed enough to write a huge comment or post about it (yet), I think it&#039;s a debate worth having. I&#039;m glad an established, respected organisation like Capsule put it out there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Re: slightly surprising &quot;music industry&quot; question)

Maybe I&#039;m in some kind of minority, but the distinction being drawn seems obvious enough.  I have definitely never thought that &quot;music industry&quot; equates directly to &quot;music and gigs&quot;.  Use one of those terms and I think of companies that lend money to a random selection of bands and artists prior to demanding it back, or mobile phone firms that endorse poor-quality venues for big concerts by bands signed to said companies.  Use the other and I think of music and gigs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know what he means, it still makes me shudder every time I hear art described as a &#039;creative industry&#039; - being lumped together with those with very different agendas to ours makes no sense.  As an artist I have as much in common with someone who designs packaging for MacDonald&#039;s, as  I have with anyone doing anything - we&#039;re on the planet together, but that&#039;s about it.  I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s what Dunc means, it&#039;s all about the music, not the industry!]]></description>
