		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for letting me sell my bags in your wonderful shop (which is a lot like a treasure trove) 
 :) you were my first outlet and have inspired me to look for boutiques and shops to showcase my things...
Please re-open!!  Birmingham needs more outlets for artists and people who like to be creative and less boring shops]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say thank you so much for hosting our BookCrossing Zone box while the shop has been open - we&#039;ve so enjoyed hearing back from the books as they make their way from the shop, it&#039;s brought a few people in for you, too, and we&#039;ll continue to update you about their journies in the future. Thanks for the support!]]></description>
