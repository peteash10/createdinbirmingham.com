		<description><![CDATA[Loved this shop... such a good idea, it&#039;s amazing no one&#039;s thought of it before. I hope it resurfaces elsewhere in the city centre some other time; there&#039;s no shortage of empty shop units, after all. Combine it with an independent coffee shop and you&#039;d be offering something the city centre is sorely lacking.

Taking the concept one step further, I&#039;d suggest something even bolder: open a shop in London. I can just see a branch on Commercial Street, Bethnal Green Road or Hackney Road. This would do more to promote Brum in the capital than the quantum of the city&#039;s past efforts combined. London&#039;s my hometown and I came up to Brum recently, in part because I&#039;d read about the CiB shop and wanted to check out its wares. And having seen them once, I&#039;m looking forward to coming back.]]></description>

Hope you guys open up again so we can do it all over again! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank YOU again for such a lovely shop / experience, for the friendly welcome, for stocking such cool stuff and for allowing us to have a BookCrossing Zone (box) and a stream of BookCrossers marching in and ferreting under the coffee table!]]></description>
