		<description><![CDATA[

I failed to ever make the journey to the CiB shop from my countryside retreat. That makes me a BAD MAN! I too am an admirer, from afar. I&#039;m due to be away this weekend but if that changes I will head over to say my farewell to this most exciting of projects. Hope to see you again, on the other side.

		<description><![CDATA[As an admirer of Birmingham from afar your shop reminds everyone that the great creative tradition of the city lives on. The nations wealth was in the main &#039;Made in Birmingham&#039;, its a pity it was spent and wasted elsewhere. With best wishes from appreciative visitors to Birmingham from the hills of the Welsh Marches in the hope that you will make a triumphant return soon. Sorry we cant be with you for the un-launch but make it a creative time!
