ARTS COUNCIL ENGLAND SUPPORTS
SUMMER SILVER EXHIBITION – BIRMINGHAM LAUNCH

‘From Songsmith to Silversmith” 

 A Fusion Of Midlands Arts and Creativity

MONDAY 7th  - SUNDAY 27th JUNE

The Birmingham Assay Office is pleased to announce that it has recently been successful in gaining support from the Arts Council England and has been awarded funding from the National Lottery to assist with the Birmingham Launch Event of British Silver Week which takes place from 7th – 27th June.

The venue for this exciting spectacle of Midlands silversmithing skill is St Pauls Gallery, located a short walk from The Birmingham Assay Office and the largest commercial art gallery in the UK outside London. 

The selling exhibition, showcasing the outstanding creative talents of Midlands contemporary silversmiths as well as other British artists is jointly sponsored by The Birmingham Assay Office, St Paul’s Gallery, The PMC Studio, Sutton Tools and D-Zine Furniture Hire.

This is a rare opportunity for the General Public to see, enjoy and even buy – unique, exquisite and exciting pieces of contemporary British Silver.

The exhibition will be shown against a backdrop of music art and sculptures, providing a fusion of two and three dimensional art media – proof if any were necessary that the Birmingham Jewellery Quarter is the jewel in the crown of the Midlands thriving artist community.
 
Theresa Nguyen, one of the ambassadors of British Silver Week 2010, and a local Birmingham Silversmith, will be providing pieces for the St Paul’s Gallery exhibition. 

 

Other artist silversmiths participating in the selling exhibition include: Andrew Macgowan, LJ Millington, Louise Chesshire, Martyn Pugh, Rachel Gogerly, Ryan McClean, Precious Metal Clay Artists, Jemma Maria Daniels, Mark Andrew Powell, Mana Sarabhai Brearley and Wally Gilbert.
