		<description><![CDATA[thanks Chris

pleased our sector was represented there - and thanks for the update on CiB.  I think it&#039;s critical that we develop a coherent presence to influence the development of the LEP.  There are already worrying signs that the divisive and fragmented attitudes that were held in check are now re-emerging and articulating themselves through numerous public channels.  These are often voiced by people who provide services for or talk about the creative and cultural sectors rather than actually earn a living and provide employment for people within them.  I suppose this is inevitable given the current positioning that is going on in the new economic climate.  

However, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss what it is our sector would want from a new LEP and how we ensure that is cogently and effectively argued for in the formation of a new LEP.  We are in danger of being seen as the sector of the &#039;noughties&#039; and we may have become a tad complacent because of the attention we did have.  Any others interested in meeting up to think through how we effectively influence the formation of the LEP - maybe one evening early next week?  Happy to host at Creative Alliance - or suitable drinking venue close by.  Noel]]></description>
