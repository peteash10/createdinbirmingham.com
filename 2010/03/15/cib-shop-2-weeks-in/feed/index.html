If you want to sell stuff, see here: 

http://cibshop.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/were-looking-for-art-to-sell/

If you just want to help out... It&#039;s been a bit crazy the last couple of weeks and while we&#039;ve had lot of people wanting to get invovled we haven&#039;t really been able to co-ordinate that involvement, if you get me. Best thing is to pop into the shop and have a chat. 

I think late March into April is when we&#039;ll really start to do things other than sell things with events and promotion and stuff that needs lots of help. Stay posted.]]></description>
