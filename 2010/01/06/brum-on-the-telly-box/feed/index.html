		<description><![CDATA[Andy - glad to say I haven&#039;t seen that one.

Dave - I&#039;m sure they do, in fact their website has been sending out updates more often recently. FB&#039;s Matthew Stanton is a top chap in my book - he bent over backwards to sort the permits when I ran Film Dash the other year. You&#039;re right though and I&#039;m sure there are a few others who deserve credit too - I saw AWM&#039;s logo in the credits fr&#039;instance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.filmbirmingham.co.uk/Filming_in_Birmingham/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Film Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; still operate? Surely the council would deserve some credit as they would have to agree to road closures etc. Brum looked good in Hustle although I hated the idea it stodd in for somewhere else. Looking forward to Survivors.]]></description>

It tarnishes the good reputation of the city.]]></description>
