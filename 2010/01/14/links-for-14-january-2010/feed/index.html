		<description><![CDATA[I was rather disappointed that Grimley&#039;s item points only to the occasional new arts building, and re-building projects. For some reason the UK promotes this kind of basic and required infrastructure re-building project (which are fairly unremarkable in Europe, and often better managed and designed), as if they were the second coming of the arts.  They&#039;re not.  They&#039;re just buildings, and are only as good as their curators.  As Grimley has eloquently pointed out before in The Post, the West Midlands comes off very badly even in terms of buildings and refurbishments, compared to elsewhere in the UK.  It&#039;s a little disappointing he doesn&#039;t mention Intervention and re:location, to major autonomous events which showed that Birmingham can curate world-class art in any type of building, and with no or very little funding.]]></description>
