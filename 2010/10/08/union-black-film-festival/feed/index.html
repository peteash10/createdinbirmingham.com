Full Circle Project - Connecting people with the screen heritage of the Midlands,

The Midland&#039;s attics, sheds, cupboards and garages are full of forgotten gems capturing local life and history. From uniquely personal home-movies to filmed events and news stories.

These are a vital part of the Midland&#039;s screen heritage.

With the help of 60 local community groups, The Media Archive for Central England (MACE) are looking for old film and videos, even home-movies created today are of interest if it documents Midlands life in some way, shape or form.

When film or video footage is found, MACE will discuss the making of copies of deposited material with the owner and with the community. The Full Circle Project will ensure the long term preservation of the original films so that they can go on being used by future generations.
