		<description><![CDATA[Good points. I find myself on the &#039;storytelling&#039; panel but am more likely to talk about local blogs as forms of alternative media representation. Some of those local blogs choose to develop a kind of narrative based around personal experience (&lt;a href=&quot;http://digbeth.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Digbeth is Good&lt;/a&gt; would be an example of that) and others utilise more traditional journalistic forms of address but attempt some innovations around that (which is what my blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://bournvillevillage.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bournvillevillage.com&lt;/a&gt; does). The current discussion around hyperlocal stuff rarely looks at modes of address so I&#039;m hoping this event will make a useful contribution to the discussion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like it could be an interesting event.. but looking at the panel members, are they using the term &#039;storytelling&#039; interchangeably with PR/media/news?  Because I think of storytelling as a creative fictional process, as distinct from &#039;reporting&#039;.  A lot of people/companies refer to enabling others to &quot;tell their stories&quot; when referring to their own experiences, again blurring the lines between actual &#039;storytelling&#039; and more personal blogging/journalism/memoirs etc.]]></description>
