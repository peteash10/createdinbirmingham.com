		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely charlatan approach to the subject of lucid dreaming. The real dreaming when one is aware that one is dreaming, is dangerous for several reasons.Firstly, you need to combat all your fears as in this state you can easily connect to a world of lower vibrations and simply be swamped with negativity which in turn becomes as real as solid physical reality. In a proper lucid dreaming state your physical body reacts to dangers as they are real, producing adrenalin and everything else thus without properly training your subconscious mind it is a very stupid thing to go into a lucid dreaming state.
This project is made for publicity and doesn&#039;t bring any value to people except it creates cheap entertainment. 
And by the way, without controlling your breath you will not be able to go into the state when one is aware of itself. Usually it takes years of everyday practice in order to safely become aware that you are dreaming.]]></description>
