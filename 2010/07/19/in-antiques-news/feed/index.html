		<description><![CDATA[Chris, pleased to see your comment re Sutton Coldfield Antiques Circle, who is your Gran?
We had a super evening with a dinner followed by an appearance of Henry VIII. All in all, a good night was had by  everyone. 
We are always looking to attract new members to our circle and currently have a membership of 78. If you can give us a mention, it would be much appreciated.
Best wishes
Andrew Pike - Hon Treasurer]]></description>
