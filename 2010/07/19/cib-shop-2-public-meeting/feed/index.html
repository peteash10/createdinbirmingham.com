		<description><![CDATA[My daughter sold her tote bags in your shop and i know she is waiting for the new shop to open.  As a college student doing art and design I am sure she will be up to help you in any art, designing kind of way.  Or just a body doing labouring etc..  We are also keen to sell our cards in your shop and would help in anyway possible.
We cannot attend the meeting tonight as we are away.  But put us down for two helpers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I think the co-op/community idea is excellent and I&#039;d be really keen to become involved. I&#039;m not sure that I can make it to the meeting on Monday but will keep up with developments. I make jewellery and sell it on folksy so I&#039;d be keen to sell in the shop. But I&#039;m equally keen to volunteer my help in any capacity.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I work for the Development Trusts Association in the West Midlands- we&#039;ve been involved in supporting the &quot;meanwhile use&quot; of empty premises across the UK over the past 12 months and have developed a range of useful resources which may help you take this forward including draft leases, an empty shops handbook and some other good practice. Go to www.meanwhile.org.uk. I&#039;m based in Birmingham but can&#039;t attend next Monday as I&#039;m away, but feel free to get in touch if there&#039;s anything else you&#039;d like to know c.weekes@dta.org.uk. Good luck, hope it goes well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great to see that plans for the shop are back in motion. Tried to register on Eventbrite using phone but wouldn&#039;t let me. I&#039;ll do it properly tomorrow, but just in case put me down for The Victoria on Monday. Can&#039;t believe it&#039;s only been 6 weeks: it feels a LOT longer. Look forward to seeing everyone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[- wonder if this could benefit in any way from Cameron&#039;s &#039;Big Society&#039; vision? Don&#039;t really know anything aout it, but if there&#039;s any funding available I&#039;d say CiB and family would be a likely contender?]]></description>
