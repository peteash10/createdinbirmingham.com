		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s probably more scope for that than would immediately be apparent, only a tiny proportion of the mosaic was saved — the rest buried. Wherever it ends up it will be a remake:

&quot;Certain important sections of the Kennedy Memorial were removed by Oliver
Budd (the son of the original artist Kenneth Budd) and are stored at his
studio. Oliver Budd has the original drawings and access to the original
suppliers of materials and it is proposed to install a remake of the
Kennedy Memorial&quot;
