		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a simple message really, the RADAR is fantastic! An absolute must read magazine  that wonderfully reflects on life in Moseley/Kings Heath and by extension, Birmingham (not &#039;Birminam&#039;...ha haa, page 34). And does it really matter that it is printed on high quality paper, of the kind that looks, feels and smells of such good quality? Probably not, but it just kinda works and adds real value to what seems to me a great editorial collective project.

I recommend you go get yourself a copy.

Huge congratulations to all those responsible for having the guts to deliver something so uniquely fresh :~)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RADAR had a great launch in Moseley, or MoHo as some silver surfers dub it.
All credit to the editorial and design team for an eclectic and stimulating range of writing, &#039;well, I would say that, wouldn&#039;t I ?&#039;, to paraphrase Birmingham&#039;s femme de scandale Mandy Rice Davies........and to find out why, you&#039;ll just have to have a good read of the magazine.]]></description>
