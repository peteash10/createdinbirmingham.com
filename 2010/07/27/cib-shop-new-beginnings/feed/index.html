		<description><![CDATA[Sadly I have no time at all to help, and so should probably be ignored, but as someone who wishes the CiB Shop the best possible chance, I&#039;d suggest considering a limited company structure and integrating a profit motive. I run a business for profit motivation, but I was also on the board of Birmingham Artists for some time, which was a members organisation similar to a cooperative, where the tenants were effectively stakeholders.

I&#039;d say there&#039;s a fundamental flaw in suggesting numbers like 300 suppliers paying a £10 membership fee. As Simon notes, this does not touch the sides financially, but it may well hamstring a benevolent dictator who might feel answerable to 300 people. CiB may effectively be subsidising these supporters by providing lower-than-market-rate rent and positioning and this will generate a communal conflict of interests. In my experience Birmingham Artists found it incredibly difficult to make important strategic decisions for this reason.

I think you can make a good case for CiB Shop being worthy of subsidisation, via free rent, or other means, but I&#039;d echo Mr Stuka&#039;s plea for a business plan. For instance: standard retail markup in galleries is, I believe, 50% and not the 25% CiB Shop charged. So if CiB shop had raised prices by 25% and retained that it might have turned over  £60K, not £45K in three months, which would provide an additional £5K of operating income per month. Would this start to make things look a little more viable?

I know profit is a dirty word for some artists (until they start making a little), but profit doesn&#039;t necessarily go straight into individual&#039;s pockets. It&#039;s the life-blood that allows you to invest and create space to operate. It&#039;s also a reasonable motivating factor for a benevolent dictator. Not the only one. But it helps.

BTW: 100 well-wishers paying £1,000 for a 0.5% share and an annual private view invite sounds a little more like it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although I coudn&#039;t make the meet (working a night shift) I&#039;m fully behind a new venture of another &#039;shop&#039; and truly believe it gives aspiring artists a real opportunity.  I have bags of enthusiasm and will help in anyway I can if called upon.  The CiB shop was so well known in all areas of Birmingham and for one made me feel, for the first time, like a real artist!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One fundamental feature where the model I outlined differs from Rhubarb Radio&#039;s setup is that the Benevolent Dictator for Rhubarb - Dan - is such because he was the primary investor and was responsible for most of the fundraising activity (&#038; also for working out a way of monetising the format in the guise of Civico); the CIBShop at this stage doesn&#039;t have a primary investor, so how might our BD emerge?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating stuff, Pete.  As someone who has also been ploughing away at a labour of love that &quot;really should happen&quot; for the past year or so - and which is now starting to take itself much more seriously and dealing with all kinds of commercial issues - I recognised much in what you&#039;ve written here and in the video presentation in particular.  My &quot;team&quot; is much more of a co-op - a dictator, benevolent or otherwise, would be given very short shrift - but nevertheless the key point is to get the right people involved.  Hope it works out for you.  We&#039;ve looked at the pop-up shop thing but it&#039;s too much of a commitment for something that would be &quot;non-core&quot; business.  We&#039;re dipping a toe in the water with a trial-run market stall in Camden (London) this Friday!]]></description>
