		<description><![CDATA[I know it&#039;s unfashionable but I&#039;m quite excited by the idea of winning it. The council proposals are a bit dull but that&#039;s only to be expected, I think there&#039;s a great opportunity for a festival fringe of truly interesting cultural events.

God knows there&#039;s enough talented people in the city, this might be something which really brings creatives in Brum together.]]></description>
