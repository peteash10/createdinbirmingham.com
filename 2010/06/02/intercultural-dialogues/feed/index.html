		<description><![CDATA[I think it looks an interesting topic. Certainly I&#039;d like to hear more about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interculturalcity.com/docs.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Intercultural City&lt;/a&gt; work and how that might apply to Birmingham (we weren&#039;t one of the case studies in the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interculturalcity.com/city_case.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Intercultural City research project&lt;/a&gt;.

But 6 quid? And two of the speakers are from MAC/Sampad anyway? Yikes. Makes me fondly recall Roger Shannon&#039;s free and excellent Lower Eastside Dialogues from a few years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Intercultural Dialogues: Such tired old meaningless jargon from the multicultural/arts wing of the state. I have no idea what is &#039;challenging&#039; or &#039;distinguished&#039; about  this kind of stuff or the people who profit from it. It&#039;s time all this nonsense was shown up for what it really is and then we can get on with real and constructive ideas about society and the arts today.]]></description>
