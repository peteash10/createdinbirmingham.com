		<description><![CDATA[I attended this event and really loved it. What a great idea to rescue abandonned plants so that they grow on elsewhere in Stirchley. 
I&#039;d really like to make contact with the artist as I wondered whether she plans to do the event again and whether she might be interested in doing some work with our local primary school. Could you pass on my email address to her.
Thanks]]></description>
