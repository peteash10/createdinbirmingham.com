		<description><![CDATA[Well for one I&#039;ve never heard of it, even when I did some research on all the various support available for creative types locally and nationally (http://www.mediatalentbank.com/blogdisplay.aspx?id=60).

In other words, I&#039;d happily pop along to one of their events if I was told about it, either on a blog like this or eflyer.

Also, their website makes no mention that they actually want to appeal to any creative/media types, particularly on the member section.

Shame really, because there are probably quite a few professionals who read sites like this, that desperately need contacts in finance, accountancy, law, etc.]]></description>
