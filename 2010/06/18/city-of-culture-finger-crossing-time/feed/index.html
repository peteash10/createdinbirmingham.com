		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I was less impressed by people spamming their stuff on there&quot;

Yeah it&#039;s disappointing, but that&#039;s pretty much how _most people_ (including &quot;the creative&quot;) online work, isn&#039;t it? Mainly it was every time I saw the words &quot;organisation&quot; or &quot;cultural offer&quot; my heart sank.

That said, this was an idea that did reach beyond the usual crowd and well worth the minimal cost/effort.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, it&#039;s all in a good cause, but I&#039;d like to have thought that people would want to support something like this for reasons other than self-interest. Like I say, I&#039;m an idealist. I suppose it gives the lie to the suggestion that folk around here can&#039;t shout up for themselves.]]></description>
