		<description><![CDATA[Chris, do you have any links for the ‘Birmingham – The Forgotten City’  that you mention or should I just go direct to Smile? I was not aware of the prints (sorry) but it sounds like it might be something worth linking to, seeing as it seems to run along the same path?
Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan,
it&#039;s true that Creative Republic have done nothing or next to nothing in public for quite some time. Lack of budget and time have been pretty restrictive but we&#039;re hoping to ease our way back into action with a new project, and given time start a programme of further activity. As for the mailing list later this week a mailout will go to everyone who has signed up with information about how to get involved once again.
Regards
Karl]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Chris!

I did sign up to Creative Republic a few years ago, but I&#039;ve never heard anything since - it looks like my login has become non existent now.]]></description>
