		<description><![CDATA[So Eric Haze isn&#039;t a graffiti artist then, either, xfrtizx? Because he developed and started producing his stuff on canvas? 

Most, but not all, but most of the graffiti in Brum now consists of recycled interpretations of other graf artists. Very rarely is there anything special about it. 

You don&#039;t have to follow the crowd in everything you do because it&#039;s been given a label. Temper didn&#039;t. Neither did Haze. Don&#039;t knock it unless you can show me something that will really knock me for six.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Banksy is NOT a graffiti artist. He does stencils, you know &quot;street-art&quot;. The mere fact that he uses spray-paint does not make his work graffiti. I suppose thats the point I was trying to get across.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Who cares what it&#039;s called, a very strange critique indeed when another of the biggest graffiti artists (Banksy) also has his work in galleries etc all over the world,  presumably he isn&#039;t entitled to call himself a graffiti artist either?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just because you use spray-paint on a canvas, that doesnt necessarily make you a &quot;graffiti artist&quot;. In fact I would put money on the fact that Temper hasnt put up a real &quot;piece&quot; in years. 

And even if he did use letters in his work, as soon as that enters a gallery, in my mind it ceases to be graffiti.]]></description>
