		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Dialogue, practical and critical help and peer support can be vital when you are trying to develop as an artist/curator/writer and presumably Rob you would agree that society benefits from having at least some of them around?&quot;

Certainly, although I&#039;m not sure what a curator actually does.

My comments on the project&#039;s funding were based on a brief trawl through the Eastside Projects and ESP websites, which seem to suggest (at least if the proliferation of logos of publicly-funded organisations is to be believed) that October could be a month of complete meltdown for any number of these bodies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For the first 18months ESP was run by the staff and directors at Eastside Projects and other artists/visitors connected to the programme (mostly giving their time for free). We have a little funding from ACE for one year but also have a growing membership - currently over 80 - who pay a small amount each month. So if the funding did go we would be able to run the programme - though we can be more ambitious with it.

I guess it depends on how you define &#039;societal benefit&#039;. ESP has supported new projects like An Endless Supply and The Lombard Method as they developed, as well as giving various emerging artists opportunities to show work, and access networks - mostly outside the region - which has helped them to begin to develop their careers. 

Eastside Projects is led by artists. We recognised we could use the gallery and its contacts and networks to benefit other people and help them to get a foothold in the world of contemporary art. I guess we figure its a long game. Personally I benefitted a lot from similar projects at an early stage in my career and that support enabled me to get to a point where I am being commissioned and included in public exhibitions and projects in the UK and Internationally. In purely economic terms this means I pay more tax so am effectively paying back that &#039;subsidy&#039;. Hopefully the work I make also has some harder to quantify cultural value also.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a paid membership thing, so guess it would depend on how many people they could get signed up to it/how much it relies on subsidy.

Anyone been and fancy reporting back?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like the sort of thing that doesn&#039;t stand a cat in hell&#039;s chance of surviving next month&#039;s Government spending bloodbath.

Maybe it&#039;s my inner Tory surfacing as I get older, but this looks to me like my taxes being spent for no obvious societal benefit?]]></description>
