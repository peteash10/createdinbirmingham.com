		<description><![CDATA[Really hate this. Not so bothered about Swordfish, those guys have never been to cool with me but Tempest, definitely a lot of respect for those guys and it really sucks to see the industry as it was die. A lot of history right there, a lot of good vibes. I seriously miss the vinyl days! Brum lost a bunch of good music stores before, now this is basically it.. Grrr]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Always found the rock and pop section in Swordfish to be pretty poor, but they used to be pretty well stocked on John Zorn albums, which was good.
