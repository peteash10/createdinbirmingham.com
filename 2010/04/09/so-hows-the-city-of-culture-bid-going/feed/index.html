		<description><![CDATA[Colin - agreed, there&#039;s some great imagery being used. I was in London over the weekend and saw a few of those posters around too

Rob - what, and give the game away to the other contenders? It feels a bit impersonal, isn&#039;t adding much and isn&#039;t making use of what the systems offer. I&#039;ve no idea what the plans are though, so that could all change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m gonna stick my head above the parapet and say the website front page sucks.  Typical top-down, one-to-many comms.  A technocrat&#039;s dream.  Some of the Have Your Say stuff is actually OK, though.

Since culture in Birmingham (beyond the CBSO, Rep and Bullring) is a bottom-up, co-created thing (We Are Eastside, Project Brutal ?), the bid might do well to reflect that.  The minute it stops looking like a BCC initiative and starts looking like something the people are doing (rather than having done to them), then we&#039;ll get some buy-in.

I&#039;ve just run (ie. helped bring together... not managed) a co-created event/process for a major national quango.  You wouldn&#039;t believe the kudos you get from just turning things over to the ppl.

BCC: be brave, act as a catalyst and a reflector of what&#039;s going on.  For starters, get a live twitter feed onto your front page, showing the world what&#039;s happening.  And don&#039;t censore, let it self-moderate and self-organise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m seconding Lisa.... 

I think there seems to be a trend for promoting mainstream or &#039;safe stuff&#039; (read shopping / conference, and top end culture stuff - REP / CBSO / BRB etc....) and yes these things are good - but when it comes to the really interesting / exciting / quirky / edgy stuff that is actually what makes the city so great it&#039;s a tad quiet.... it&#039;s like there&#039;s a percieved fear of the unknown.....either &#039;those responible for marketing the city&#039; have experienced enough, or they feel that quirky is too risky to promote.... 

To be honest though, I think I&#039;d just be happy if people just stopped with the Manchester / London / Liverpool / Bristol comparission game.... who says we want to be like those cities anyway?! 

I&#039;m not an original Brummie, and I&#039;m not all that bothered whether we win or not truthfully - I choose to live here, and continue to enjoy the diverse range of stuff to do / see / experience. Birmingham rocks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could the problem be that the people responsible for promoting the city aren&#039;t very good at recognising the amazing stuff currently going on in their city? I have no doubt Birmingham could be a winner if this was done with buy in from those actually creating the culture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re right Chris, we do deserve to win this, but the fact is that we&#039;re just not as good as some cities (London and particularly Manchester spring to mind) at shouting about what&#039;s going on culturally in this city: it&#039;s why websites like CiB have to exist - to join the cultural dots up - and why there doesn&#039;t seem to be much promotion for this campaign, in or outside of the region.

I&#039;m not sure what the answer is. Maybe the council should be engaging more with the myriad of creative, ideas-driven people and businesses in this city to develop a far wider reaching campaign of activity that serves to sing the praises of Birmingham in the same way that Manchester&#039;s great at.

But then I remember why this won&#039;t happen, and my mind goes back to a Business Link suppliers register seminar I attended some time back. One of the speakers said, after completion of a great project, the best praise you could expect from a West Midlands&#039; company owner would be &#039;it turned out alright.&#039; Not fantastic, amazing, or anything like that.

We need to learn to shout about our achievements as a city more. That&#039;s the start of achieving great things like being awarded the City of Culture.]]></description>
