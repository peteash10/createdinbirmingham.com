		<description><![CDATA[As Dave has linked - the CF model is actually really simple and useful.  It&#039;s about identifying where young people are at (creatively) and enables arts providers to support them in developing their own interests at a level appropriate to them.

Eg. John likes drawing.  He&#039;s never been to a gallery before, nor has he shared any of his drawings with anyone else.  He likes watching animated films, and reads graphic novels.  In this imaginary example we&#039;d be able to see quickly that he&#039;s already operating as a &#039;creator&#039; but has limited experience as a &#039;participant&#039;.  Finding new exhibitions for him to visit might be one way of helping him develop his creativity, or perhaps a group class somewhere like the mac.  He may also want to find ways of sharing his work - either in person (exhibitions etc) or online (less confrontational!)

There&#039;s loads of stuff happening under the CF banner and a website is currently in development.  Many large arts orgs are delivering work that links into this strategy and currently we are responsible for developing a pilot youth arts signposting service that targets three areas of Birmingham: 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativefuture-whatson.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://creativefuture-whatson.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;

In addition, Hybrid are delivering a series of professional development work which links in as well - more info can be found here:

(as a small side note, we talked to you about this a few months ago Chris! :)]]></description>
