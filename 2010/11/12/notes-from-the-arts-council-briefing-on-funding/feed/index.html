		<description><![CDATA[Chris - you have in your notes that organisations will be required to meet 4 of the 5 aims - its actually only 2 that you need to meet. (phew!) And no extra points for meeting any more than 2 either.
Cheers!

		<description><![CDATA[I agree Ros Robins was and is refreshingly direct. The Arts Council are certainly not the enemy, even if for various reasons people can grow frustrated with them. It&#039;s going to be rough out there - just like the old days. The 1980s are BACK!]]></description>
