		<description><![CDATA[We have a huge amount of excellent quality craft supplies which we sell to raise money for a local Birmingham Charity - Birmingham PHAB Camps. We are aiming to raise enough money to buy a portable hoist which costs around £2,300 and we have raised around £1,500 so far.

All the stock we have is donated to us through a company that packs craft supplies for companies like Ideal World. It is basically their leftovers. It&#039;s wonderful stuff and because we don&#039;t pay for it it means we can sell it at rock bottom prices.

We have cards and envelopes, scrapbook papers, paper and card of all types, decoupage, ribbon, embellishments, glitter and sequins, and much much more.

Are you interested in us coming to one of your groups with our goodies?

Give me a call if you are - Maxine 07812 384265]]></description>
