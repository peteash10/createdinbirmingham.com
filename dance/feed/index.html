<p>It&#8217;s not just in the city centre that exciting arts events are happening. This week in Yardley a school group will be promoting their local community centre in what could be the start of an interesting new arts/community space.</p>
<p>Children from <a href="http://www.oasisacademyhobmoor.org/">Oasis Academy Hobmoor</a> have joined with Coventry-based digital-dance company <a href="http://www.mercurialarts.co.uk/">Mercurial Arts</a> to create a new dance performance for their community. Working collaboratively since May, sixty Year 5 pupils have worked on the project, inspired by and exploring neuroscience.</p>
<p>As well as the dance performance, half of the children have been working on a ‘Digital Play Space’ to compliment the work featuring insights into the brain, interactive projections, film footage and sound using new technologies.</p>
<p>As a starting point, the children visited the University of Birmingham&#8217;s Medical School for in-depth investigations into the workings of the brain, and looked into complex questions such as, ‘Where do ideas and movements come from in the body?’</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17856" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3-610x405.jpg" alt="Ruqqayah and Laura at the University of Birmingham Medical School - Credit Toni Kerr 3" width="610" height="405" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3-610x405.jpg 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Ruqqayah-and-Laura-at-the-University-of-Birmingham-Medical-School-Credit-Toni-Kerr-3.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>Mercurial Arts’ Artistic Director Oliver Scott said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>One of the exciting things about this project is we can set the children complex and real challenges. Not only will they become a fully-fledged dance company making their own new work, they will share it with the general public. It is an ambitious task that develops physical, personal and social skills that will stand them in good stead in many contexts</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Chaotic Liquid Network </em></strong>is part of an exploration into the brain <strong>Mercurial Arts</strong> have been undertaking over the last year, and first investigated during their project <strong><em>The Seed</em></strong>, performed at the Coventry Mysteries festival in 2013.</p>

Book via the<a href="http://www.oasisacademyhobmoor.org/"> school</a>. The Digital Play Space will be open as a drop-in, from 11am-3pm on Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 July 2014.</p>

<blockquote><p>Referencing the ancient and the futuristic, B-Town sees elemental forces of good and evil harness the energy of our city, battling across the continents in Birmingham&#8217;s landmark Victoria Square.

<p style="text-align: justify;">With all the build-up and enthusiasm for dance performances during <a title="Get Your Dancing Shoes – IDFB 2014" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2014/04/26/idfb-2014/" target="_blank">IDFB</a> I feel well and truly ready for BE Festival 2014. Having not personally attended <a title="The first BE Festival" href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/08/the-first-be-festival/" target="_blank">BE Festival</a> before I was a little unsure of what to expect, and so took the opportunity to visit the 2014 launch at Birmingham Rep on the 16<sup>th</sup> April. I was quickly immersed into a world of acting, exciting workshops and performers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BE Festival has been hosted in Birmingham since 2010 after responding to an Arts Council-hosted conference entitled, ‘The Challenge of Change: How can we make a better future for theatre, here in the West Midlands?’ in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5 years on, the realised dream of BE Festival still continues. Having invited performers from 11 different countries to take part in this years’ amazing selection of 22 performances, the festival has already attracted a large following.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/93095334"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/teatro-sotterraneo.jpg" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year The Rep will open their doors to BE Festival, with the main stage itself set to feature a pop-up restaurant. There they will be serving delicious interval dinners to artists and audiences so that they can have an opportunity to eat together each evening. The menus include vegetarian options and advance bookings for this are now available through box-office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://befestival.org/festival/dinner-2014/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://befestival.org/wp-content/gallery/images-2013/restaurant.jpg" width="448" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ll now be able to see all of the wonderful events planned which include visual arts and talks, workshops, performances and even musical post-show events, finishing with an Awards Party on the 12th of July.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are all very excited to tell you about the return of the <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/idfb-2014" target="_blank">International Dance Festival Birmingham 2014</a>! You will be able to experience a range of performances from ballet to large non-choreographed social dances. With <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on" target="_blank">so many</a> brilliant performances to talk about, the following will just be a selection of my top picks for the festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-17529"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>For Starters, &#8216;Three Short Works&#8217; 24th &#8211; 26th April</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The International Dance Festival Birmingham 2014 kicks off with &#8216;Three Short Works&#8217;. From the Birmingham Royal Ballet, a selection of performances called Quatrain, Kin, Les Rendezvous and Façade. Les Rendezvous will be available to see from 24th–25th April, with Quatrain and Kin continuing to be shown alongside Façade on 26th April.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">QUATRAIN</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by the fantastically exciting and vibrant tango rhythms of Astor Piazzolla&#8217;s The Four Season&#8217;s of Buenos Aires, Company First Artist Kit Holder creates his third ballet for the Company. Following the success of his previous work, 9-5, which featured in IDFB 2012, these premiere performances of his latest work are keenly anticipated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">KIN.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An exciting new ballet from Royal Opera House Choreographic Affiliate, Sadler&#8217;s Wells New Wave Associate and former Birmingham Royal Ballet dancer, Alexander Whitley. The ballet, to music by young American composer Phil Kline, will receive its’ premiere at IDFB 2014. Not to be missed!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LES RENDEZVOUS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A huge hit when it was first performed in 1933, Les Rendezvous was the first ballet in which Ashton put aside the comedy for which he was known and concentrated on pure technique. Loosely based round a group of friends meeting up in a park, the ballet is a series of fiercely difficult divertissements which give the whole cast the chance to show off their virtuosity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FACADE</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, based on Edith Sitwell&#8217;s deliciously nonsensical poetry, Façade embraces the fun of it all with whole-hearted and wilful abandon. Be entertained by a series of delightful characters dancing tangos, foxtrots and waltzes, all with their tongues firmly in their cheeks. Choreographed in 1931, Façade was Sir Frederick Ashton&#8217;s first big hit, and is full of the gentle comedy he is known and loved for &#8211; an enjoyable break from the sanity of everyday life!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"></h4>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">World Premier, ‘Headphones’ 30th April – 4th May</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promising to provide us with a fresh organic series of performances, <a href="http://www.coreybakerdance.com/about/" target="_blank">Corey Baker</a> brings us ‘Headphones’. In keeping with Corey Bakers’ ethos of producing engaging and unique productions, ‘Headphones’ will allow the audience to direct part of the dancers’ choreography. Set to hide ‘undercover’, the performances will be surprising and unpredictable with elements of comedy.</p>
<p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eEWFIx0EL4" target="_blank">this</a> trailer to get an idea of the fun performance, as well as directly suggest moves by tweeting @IDFB #headphones.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217; 14th–17th May</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.new-adventures.net/matthew_bourne" target="_blank">Mathew Bourne</a> has invited 24 young people to join his latest hit production <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies" target="_blank">&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217;</a> based on the classic novel written by William Goulding. There are 8 professional dancers within the cast, to work alongside the newly recruited dancers to give a unique opportunity to young dancers in each city that the production is set to perform in. Because of this the theatre performance has already gained great <a href="http://www.new-adventures.net/latest_news/bbc_breakfast_interview_on_lord_of_the_flies" target="_blank">publicity</a>. The combination of mentoring and unity has made the project a wonderful success already and should be a great motivational piece, especially for young people who with a passion for dance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.idfb.co.uk/images/made/images/remote/http_s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/idfb/IDFB_2014/LOTF_press_imagegallery_632_300_c1.jpg" width="506" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217; will be performed at The Birmingham Hippodrome over 4 days with tickets available <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/lord-of-the-flies" target="_blank">now</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>&#8216;Spill: A Playground of Dance&#8217; – 25th May</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2011/08/11/dancexchange/" target="_blank">DanceXchange</a> is housed within <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/" target="_blank">Birmingham Hippodrome</a>, both of whom have worked together to produce the 2014 International Dance Festival Birmingham. Owning 3 dance studios and <a href="http://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/default.asp?Id=77&amp;sC=page4" target="_blank">The Patrick Centre</a> (a 206 seat studio), DanceXchange strives to support the dancing community and enable their dancers to showcase the best of their talents. &#8216;Spill&#8217; was first shown in 2012, and is an outdoor production that will be performed in the beautiful Cannon Hill Park. Choreographed by Australian Artist Shaun Parker, of Shaun Parker &amp; Company, it should be a playful piece using street gymnastics and location based props of swings and roundabouts.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/" target="_blank">International Dance Festival Birmingham (IDFB)</a> one of Europe&#8217;s biggest dance festivals, co-produced by DanceXchange and Birmingham Hippodrome, returns for its fourth year.

<blockquote><p>In less than three months’ time, this award-winning biennial celebration of dance, returns to the city from Thursday 24th April 2014 – Sunday 25th May for over four weeks of world premieres, unique collaborations, community events, outdoor spectacles and world-class performances.</p>
<p>With more theatre shows than in previous years, featuring some of the biggest names in dance, and some of the most hotly tipped rising choreographic stars IDFB 2014 will showcase the best international dance in venues and outdoor spaces across the buzzing festival city of Birmingham.</p></blockquote>
<p>I must admit I have never been to an <a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/" target="_blank">IDFB</a> event &#8211; but from looking through the programme and reading a bit more about what&#8217;s going on, I can see that there is a lot happening that will appeal to a lot of tastes and curiosities. I  like the look of this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/whats-on/all-of-birmingham-is-a-stage-exhibition" target="_blank"><strong>All of Birmingham is a Stage</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2014/01/30/international-dance-festival-birmingham-2014/screen-shot-2014-01-29-at-18-25-31/" rel="attachment wp-att-16989"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16989" alt="All of Birmingham is a stage" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-01-29-at-18.25.31-610x180.png" width="610" height="180" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-01-29-at-18.25.31-610x180.png 610w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-01-29-at-18.25.31-300x88.png 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-01-29-at-18.25.31-900x265.png 900w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-01-29-at-18.25.31.png 985w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Students from BCU&#8217;s School of Architecture have been working with DanceXchange to imagine how disused or unloved corners of Birmingham could be transformed into performance spaces.</p>
<p>See the results in an exhibition which aims to kick-start regeneration and community development projects across the city. On Thursday and Friday look out for pop-up performances by Birmingham Ormiston Academy dance students, inspired by the architectural designs. The exhibition forms part of <a href="http://birmingham-made-me.org/" target="_blank">Birmingham Made Me 2014</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Have a look through the <a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.idfb.co.uk/" target="_blank">IDFB website</a> for more information and for other events.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote: The new IDFB website is rather nice. when it&#8217;s not in festival mode, it functions as an archive of past events. Very cleverly designed by Birmingham based <a href="http://www.supercooldesign.co.uk/">Supercool</a>.</em></p>
