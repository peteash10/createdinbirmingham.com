				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.kirstymdesigns.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kirsty M</a> is a papercraft artist/illustrator from the Black Country &#8211; she&#8217;s very recently relocated and is now based in Cornwall.</p>
<p>Last year Kirsty was asked to be part of <a href="http://www.handmade-boutique.co.uk/" target="_blank">Handmade Boutique</a>, the pop-up shop shop in the Great Western Arcade. In response to this she created a beautiful, intricate piece of artwork of some recognisable Birmingham landmarks cut out of paper (shown below).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little about Kirsty M:</p>
<blockquote><p>Armed with a pencil, a scalpel, a piece of paper and a lot of patience I create beautiful hand drawn and hand cut art work. All my designs are unique, created by me Kirsty Mason. I don&#8217;t use computer software or any fancy cutting machines to create this art. I just use my imagination and my tiny hands to create these beautiful pieces of art, that would look amazing on any wall. I use only the best quality paper and spend hours hand drawing and hand cutting each piece.</p></blockquote>

<p>We&#8217;ve written about <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/?s=handmade+boutique" target="_blank">Handmade Boutique a few times</a>, but just incase it&#8217;s new to you, here&#8217;s some handy blurb about the shop<span style="font-size: 13px;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.handmade-boutique.co.uk/" target="_blank">Handmade Boutique</a> is a collective of Midlands based independent designers that make beautiful home styling and lifestyle products and gifts for all ages. The store’s unique concept allows local independent designers to bring their beautifully hand made products directly to you on the high street. from bath products and candles, to jewellery, ceramics and textile pictures, you’ll also find a great selection of greetings cards and gift wrap – so you’ll never get stuck when out gift buying again!</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the UK, July is becoming known as <em>independent retailers month</em>, an annual push for shopping local. Last week was <a href="http://www.shoppinginbirmingham.com/">Shopping in Birmingham</a>&#8216;s &#8216;Celebration of Independents&#8217; in Birmingham City Centre &#8211; they did a few things in celebration of this, including producing a guide to independent retailers in the city centre which is available <a href="http://www.shoppinginbirmingham.com/news/a-week-long-celebration-of-independents">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Handmade-Boutique/354331784644515?fref=ts">Handmade Boutique</a> opened on a permanent basis in the Great Western Arcade last week to coincide with this too. &#8220;Handmade Boutique is a collective of 18 Midlands based independent designers that make beautiful home styling and lifestyle products and gifts for all ages.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were also some unique grassroots style events taking place: a &#8216;swopshop&#8217; was organised by <a href="http://letruc.co.uk/">Le Truc</a>. This involved a series of collaborations between 13 independent businesses. There were some great collaborations including <a href="http://provideshop.com/">Provide</a> and <a href="http://yorksbakerycafe.co.uk/">Yorks Bakery Café</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfoQi6GjZpg">The Diskery</a> at <a href="http://www.sixeightkafe.co.uk/">6/8 Kafé</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AndersonandHill">Anderson &amp; Hill Cheese</a> at the <a href="http://www.postofficevaults.co.uk/">Post Office Vaults</a>. <a href="http://provideshop.com/">Provide</a> covered it nicely on their blog, and there are some <a href="http://provideshop.com/blogs/news/8282993-independent-swop-shop">great photos of the Provide/Yorks Bakery Café swap</a> by our very own <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/author/craig-bush/">Craig Bush</a>. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Handmade-Boutique/354331784644515?fref=ts"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;</p>
<p>Meanwhile in <a href="http://enjoykingsheath.com/">Kings Heath</a>, they are celebrating the fact that every month is independent month, as the town is awash with an eclectic mix of successful independent businesses that really shape what Kings Heath is all about.</p>
<p>One business in particular has shown what it really means to be an ‘independent retail business’- as <a href="http://www.thepeopleshop.co.uk/">People Shop</a> on Poplar Road is not just any other independent business, they make all their own stock themselves – from dresses, to homeware, gifts and jewellery – it is all created on site, in the studio at the rear of the store. “We are so proud to be an independent and to be based in the heart of Kings Heath, which is just a vibrant and buzzing corner of the West Midlands. I don’t think there is a place like it, with so much going on – and yet for those who don’t live on the doorstep it always seems to come as such a pleasant surprise that Kings Heath has got so much to offer.” explains Allison, one of the three owners of <a href="http://www.thepeopleshop.co.uk/">People Shop</a>.</p>
<p>Allison has a lovely blog <a href="http://www.hellohomey.sqsp.com/">Hello Homey</a>, and she also runs a new monthly event <a href="http://www.hellohomey.sqsp.com/hellohomeyblog/2013/4/30/the-sewcial-club-">The Sewcial Club</a> &#8211; an alternative style sewing workshop *night out*.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Handmade-Boutique/354331784644515"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13101" title="Handmade Boutique" src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2012-09-13-at-17.49.20-300x212.png" alt="" width="300" height="212" srcset="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2012-09-13-at-17.49.20-300x212.png 300w, http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2012-09-13-at-17.49.20.png 553w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The boutique plans to give customers the opportunity to purchase unique lifestyle products and gifts that would not usually be available on the high street. As well as the opportunity to purchase, customers will also be offered live demonstrations from some of the designer makers to allow them to see how the products are made and giving them a hands on experience by being able to take something home they have made.</p>
<p>There are quite a few individuals featuring in the Boutique but here are a few of my favourites;</p>
<ul>

<li>Weave and Stitch who make one off creations made entirely from paper!</li>
</ul>
