				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Year&#8217;s Eve. You either either love it or you hate it. Or you watch Jools Holland. Either way, <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/2011/12/31">there&#8217;s a lot going on in Birmingham</a> to see in the new year, so here&#8217;s a NYE selection.</p>
<p>If you want to dance your way into 2012, there are plenty of clubs offering NYE nights. <a href="http://www.gatecrasher.com/venues/birmingham/events/nye/new-years-eve/index.html">Gatecrasher</a> have got 2manydjs, Eric Prydz, AN21 and Max Vangelli, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/218551351549539/">Bigger Than Barry are at The Old Crown</a>, <a href="http://venues.meanfiddler.com/hmv-institute/listings/featured-gigs/5514">Eclectricity at the HMV Institute</a> with Chase &amp; Status and Annie Mac, <a href="http://www.hennesseysbar.com/page37.htm">Hott Date are doing a thing at Hennesseys</a> and <a href="http://www.theticketsellers.co.uk/buy_tickets/venues/?id=3437">Glas will meet Face at The Rainbow</a>. Everywhere else has got a thing going on though.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d rather keep things slightly more pub-based, then Island Bar and The Victoria are <a href="http://www.bar-island.co.uk/?page_id=14&amp;event_id=50">getting together for a joint celebration</a>. Sam Redmore and This is TMRW are <a href="http://hareandhoundskingsheath.co.uk/2011/11/21/new-years-eve-party-2/">looking after the Hare and Hounds</a> and there&#8217;s a &#8216;live fast and die young&#8217; fancy-dress night at <a href="http://www.thefightingcocksmoseley.co.uk/offer/news-newyearseve/">The Fighting Cocks</a> in Moseley. Your local will probably be open too.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Birmingham City Council are putting on <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/newyear">&#8220;low level pyrotechnics&#8221; in Victoria Square</a> while the Big Screen will show the BBC One New Year Celebrations between 10pm and 12.30am.</p>
<p>Music is covered too, with The Subterraneans at The Jam House, The Father Teds at The Irish Centre, <a href="http://livebrum.co.uk/2011/12/31/nye-soul-survivors"> Soul Survivors at Sutton Town Hall</a>, and <a href="http://www.thsh.co.uk/event/new-years-eve-gala-matinee/">Symphony Hall&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Eve Gala</a>.</p>
<p>And finally if you need a laugh after this long year, there&#8217;s comedy at <a href="http://www.glee.co.uk/shows/birmingham-31-12-2011-new-years-eve-party-night-the-best-in-live-stand-up-comedy-studio-room.htm">The Glee Club</a>, <a href="http://www.thehighlight.co.uk/event/fosters-comedy-live-present-new-years-eve-7">Highlight</a> and <a href="http://www.jongleurs.com/show/Birmingham-12-31-2011-21-00-00">Jongleurs</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just past the halfway point&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/27/cib-shop-new-beginnings/">Pete kicked off discussions</a> about how to follow on from the CiB Shop, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/27/the-little-chill/">The Little Chill looked like fun</a> and involved pretty much every promoter in town and <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/26/supersonic-2010/">Supersonic&#8217;s line-up</a> started coming together.</p>
<p>There was a lot of kerfuffle around <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/26/filming-turbulence/">the filming of Turbulence</a>, with lots of people getting involved in that too, and people seemed to be printing <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/25/poster-type-flyers/">big flyers for things</a>. I didn&#8217;t make it to <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/17/taste-of-birmingham-2010/">Taste of Birmingham</a> but people tell me it was pretty good. We also flagged up the work of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/12/sweaty-eskimo/">Sweaty Eskimo</a>.</p>
<p>BARG announced some <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/24/barg-taste-the-game/">fun and games at the Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/23/haji-noor-deen-at-the-hubb/">Haji Noor Deen visited The Hubb</a>, the Cut Out Shop folks made <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/06/the-diy-times/">The DIY Times</a> and I did a bit of a write-up from the <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/08/the-first-be-festival/">BE Festival</a>. New Art Gallery Walsall <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/18/photos-at-nagw/">hosted the Taylor Wessing Photography Prize</a> for a while and the entirely excellent-looking <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/16/six-summer-saturdays/">Six Summer Saturdays</a> started.</p>
<p>There was news of cuts from the new government and I tried to wrap my head around the mess that was being made of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/20/about-these-leps/">sorting out a LEP</a> for Birmingham/West Midlands. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/13/the-flyeringpostering-issue/">The flyering/postering issue</a> got another run out too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/07/15/maybe-next-time/">Birmingham didn&#8217;t get the nod for City of Culture 2013</a>. Ah well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer brought with it <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/13/birmingham-degree-shows/">degree show time of year</a> and also <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/its-the-first-be-festival-soon/">the first Birmingham European Theatre Festival</a> (which I&#8217;m pleased to see will be back again this year). Listings started coming out for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/the-hmv-institute/">the HMV Institute</a> too.</p>
<p>The days were getting longer, which was probably just as well for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/19/rhubarb-collision-hungry/">Rhubarb Rhubarb, who seemed to doing loads</a>. Birmingham presented its <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/city-of-culture-finger-crossing-time/">final bid for the City of Culture</a> and we crossed our fingers. Temper <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/30/cut-from-a-different-cloth/">filled the streets with fashion icons</a>. We looked at the trailer for <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/24/soulboy-trailer/">Soulboy</a> and discovered <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/23/reuben-colley-fine-arts-blog/">the blog for Reuben Colley Fine Arts</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/18/arts-funding-cuts-in-the-west-midlands/">Arts Council announced a 0.5% cut</a> in funding to RFO&#8217;s. Boo. We found <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/15/synth-eastwood-in-birmingham/">some familiar faces</a> in Synth Eastwood&#8217;s video tomfoolery from the Flatpack Festival. <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/14/treasured-a-secret-journey/">Treasured</a> at the MAC looked good.</p>
<p>Bright Space started looking for people to get involved in <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/11/platform-2/">Platform</a> and I asked &#8216;<a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/08/does-birmingham-future-interest-you/">Does Birmingham Future interest you?</a>&#8216; and got a fairly resounding &#8216;Um, who?&#8217;. Theatre folk came together and spoke easy, the newly opened Zellig hosted the Bass Festival&#8217;s <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/04/speakeasy/">Fight The Power exhibition</a> and there was talk of <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/verbalise-and-visualise/">verbalising and visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>Creative Republic launched <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/21/creative-republics-invisible-city-project/">Invisible City</a> and Marketing Birmingham released <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2010/06/01/a-couple-of-videos/">a new promotional video for the city</a> that featured a host of creative talent.</p>
