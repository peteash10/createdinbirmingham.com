		<description><![CDATA[I often use They Work.. to keep tabs on Lynne Jones (my local MP) and the Write to.. site was very useful for me to spam loads of Lords over their quite odd support for the (disturbingly random) &#039;badger cull to control bovine TB&#039; bill that was going through Parliament. Great tools. 

I bet mySociety thought the PM might listen to the odd one.

I&#039;m off to create a petition to urge the PM to &quot;take notice and act upon one of these petitions, instead of just emailing signitaries with a link to a list of excuses.&quot; 

I&#039;ll sign the photo one while I&#039;m there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s probably worth noting that whatever the government&#039;s motivations for adopting the petition site it&#039;s being run with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysociety.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mySociety&lt;/a&gt;, a non-partisan, non-profit group who are also responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.writetothem.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Write to them&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theyworkforyou.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;They Work For You&lt;/a&gt; which exist to help citizens keep their elected representatives to account, so the origins are pretty sound. 

I&#039;m a cynical as hell about these sorts of things and it&#039;s by no means a quick and easy answer to dealing with problems, but it does help to highlight stuff and make people aware of issues, or at least that they&#039;re not alone. If it does turn out that there&#039;s a threat here then I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll lead to something more organised.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sign the petition by all means, but don&#039;t expect it to inform the governments thinking in any way.
From the &#039;road pricing&#039; one to the one pleading for help to stop the dreadful wage slashing in the name of equality that Staffordshire County Council are up to (http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=10703), the responses are a list of reasons why the govenrment will not change its position.

They&#039;re in thraw to big buisness and certain pressure groups - &#039;the public&#039; will not influence them one bit.

If this is a really serious threat, and I&#039;m not sure it is, then what is really needed is an organised campain.

Is it a conspiracy theory to suggest that the internet pettiton site is one of Tony Blairs great spin materpieces? It&#039;s so easy to set one up that no actual orgaisation or well throught-through campain is needed - people don&#039;t have to communicate, organise or form into groups that can pressure government.

Put in your email and we can tell you all, individually, why we&#039;re not listening.]]></description>
