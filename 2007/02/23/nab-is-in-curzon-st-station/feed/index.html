		<description><![CDATA[My interest is that my gg grandad was manager of this place in 1901... surely the restoration of St Pancras (the other end) should have an impact on the revival of this beautiful building. I think its in peril and needs to be a focus for art and history for the city.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if they were involved but it does seem like the station is a bit cursed. I reckon we won&#039;t see any concrete moves to develop it until the Big Park is finished.

Oddly, for such an imposing building, it&#039;s really small inside thanks to the massive staircase. That might be why no-one wants to occupy it.]]></description>
