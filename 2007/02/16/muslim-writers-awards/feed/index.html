		<description><![CDATA[Hi
Could you please update your site with details of the 2008 awards??

Building on the outstanding success of the inaugural Muslim Writers Awards on 28 March 2007, it is clear that there are many emerging writers who have the talent and potential to get published. So we are pleased to announce the Awards will now become an annual event. If you would like further details on how to submit work, please contact Nikki Bi (nikki.bi@birmingham.gov.uk) or Irfan Akram via: (irfan@innovatepartnership.com).]]></description>
