		<description><![CDATA[I know where you&#039;re coming from on this. It&#039;s only now I&#039;m seeing and using it every day that I don&#039;t cringe at the &quot;creative&quot; tag. Isn&#039;t being creative just something that all humans do? Do we include cooks? Couples trying for babies?

That said, it&#039;s just a word. And handy umbrella term that can be used in this context without worrying about the semantics too much. There&#039;s nothing novel about The Novel after all.  

But I&#039;m someone who calls himself a Blogger so I can&#039;t really talk...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t like that term &quot;Creative&quot;, it always feels like its the lazy catch all to define &quot;those people over there&quot; typically used by employers/clients to define us people who do the messy stuff for them. 

Birmingham seems particularly hung up on the term, there must be around 20-30 arts projects with Creative in the title, isn&#039;t there a better term? At least one we could use internally amongst us people who make stuff?]]></description>
