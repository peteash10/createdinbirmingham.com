		<description><![CDATA[No plans to podcast this one I&#039;m afraid, it sits a little bit outside the core Pub Conversation series and we didn&#039;t feel it would be appropriate on this occasion.

Thanks to everyone who came (not a dig at you Pete - You Can Haz Nyoorowfen?) and especially to Lucy  for doing a great job as guest speaker and chairperson.

I&#039;ll make sure you&#039;re aware of any follow-up coming from Self Service (or email selfservice@hotmail.co.uk if you want to be added to the mailing list), but it would lead nicely on from the spirit of the evening&#039;s discussion if people from outside of SS disseminated their views on the subject too, since I think reaction and objectives will differ greatly amongst people in different situations.]]></description>
