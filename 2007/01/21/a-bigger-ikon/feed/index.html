		<description><![CDATA[I agree with both Jonathan and Glenn, as a major global city Birmingham has to be ambitious, and major public buildings and cultural institutions need to figure prominently in capturing and exciting the public in this goal.  Developing a creative cluster will also help to develop  the vibrancy that will make people want to come and live and work here, and bring visitors who want to do more than shop...

However, the city needs to articulate this vision, and I have a personal view that this is what seems lacking at present.  What do others think?  

In my job I work with many businesses and they often seem to try to &quot;save their way to prosperity&quot; which cannot be done... real prosperity comes from growth, from looking forward and seeing the future, and investing in the belief of reaching that goal.  We need city leaders to grasp this... to pick up the ball and run with it... we need a mayor who is visionary, who leads from the front, who has, and shows, agreater ambition than cities who compete with Birmingham! 

Perhaps if this were to happen then the public might follow him?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d agree that the city would benefit from another gallery but doubt it will ever happen. Look at West Brom and that lovely Public building that seems destined to never open. I really don&#039;t understand what&#039;s happening with that project. I have to wonder if it would have been more successful if it had been sited in Birmingham?]]></description>
