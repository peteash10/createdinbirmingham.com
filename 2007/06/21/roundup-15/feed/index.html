		<description><![CDATA[Interesting link regarding the Advantage West Midlands quango. Always nice to see publicly funded bodies acting in a manner that is both transparent and accountable. Thank you for pointing, I think it&#039;s important for these sorts of things to be brought out into the open.

This if off topic so feel free to edit but there&#039;s a few bits of art floating about in the Epic Skate Park cafe/bar put together by myself and a friend if you (or anybody else for that matter)get chance to drop by that&#039;d be lovely.
