		<description><![CDATA[I use Wordpress because it allows you to add various extra plug-ins and allows you to host your blog on your own web server if you want to do more advanced things or have your own web address instead of something standard like myname.blogger.com 

In general - Blogger is a good place to start if you don&#039;t want to have to deal with anything technical and don&#039;t have any needs to do anything very out of the ordinary - just writing good content.

Wordpress.com is the blogger equivalent - instant setup, easy to post and manage content and you get a blog at myname.wordpress.com

At Wordpress.org there is a free downloadable version of the software for people who feel comfortable with technical things or who want to customise their blog to a large extent. 

This option allows you to use your own web address. 

Some hosts come with Wordpress already installed - http://wordpress.org/hosting/

Hope some of that helps...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pete - slightly OT here - I note you use both Wordpress and Blogger. Why do you employ both? And what system do you think is best overall? A short answer will suffice, as I will research the Wordpress site extensively before (if) I change allegiances. Ta, Ken.]]></description>
