		<description><![CDATA[Cheers Pete, I did construct a website a number of years ago and whilst attempting to up-load it sent it to somewhere left of Jupiter. I know now that when Frontpage asked me for the second time &quot;Do you really, really want to delete Birminghamirish.com and send it, forever, to the left of Jupiter?&quot; I should not have pressed &quot;Yes&quot;. 150 hours of work down the drain! 60-year-olds shouldn&#039;t be allowed near these machines.
www.keepdigbethvibrant.co.uk an on-line petition in support of The Dog is getting interesting. It&#039;s hosted by an Abacus resident, Adam Crossley (long may he have a drink problem).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your support (I&#039;m the licensee of The Spotted Dog). Unfortunately your link above is to the other Spotted Dog, a venue that is well worth a visit if you like live music. Alas, when the developers turn their rapacious gaze on their part of Digbeth, that Spotted Dog will face the same fate as mine. Coffee house? Wine bar? Tesco? Another venue for young bands will bite the dust. We&#039;ve been rolled over for too long by a Council (of whichever hue) which only works efficiently in one sphere -ENFORCEMENT. Isn&#039;t it time to rise up and say &quot;Enough&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I were to rent or buy a home beside a canal would it then be logical for me to ask it be filled in. Perhaps I could claim that I was living in fear that my cat/dog/child/self may fall in and drown. Perhaps the chug chug chug of passing narrow boats was a real annoyance. If the sound of the sea breaking on the shore troubled you, don&#039;t go and live by the sea.

I find it difficult to understand how someone who is able to write a letter of complaint or telephone unaided, could not have seen that there was a community spirited, musically orientated pub on the opposite corner. I have been aware of the music and fabulous charity fund raising events that have taken place at or based from the dog. The complainant must have lived under a very big stone in previous abode not to have similar knowledge. They only had to ask.  Pre-contract searches and enquiries would reveal such matters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I fear that the neo-residents would speak up if a bat or grasshopper farted or had a small coughing episode.

Welcome to the city; welcome to the quarter which is the epitome of spirit and noise, albeit visual, audible or downright multisensory.

Yum! What a soundtrack to wind down to....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That may be true but the recorded noise level is what matters and sadly for the residents who have complained, in law, they won&#039;t get far if it can be demonstrated beyond any doubt that passing traffic is louder. I have some good Lawyer contacts to offer the spotted Dog if the residents who have complained want to take it further. In The meantime perhaps the Spotted Dog could acknowledge them if they make themselves known and request them to keep the communication going so as to resolve the issue amicably for the benefit of all involved. Sometimes a friendly chat and a voluntary agreement to consider each others needs may achieve more results]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m no expert but I believe it&#039;s more about the nature of the sound than the simple dB level. Yes, you can live with the constant drone of traffic but a floor-shaking bass, even if it&#039;s quieter, will be more disturbing. I guess it&#039;s like a dripping tap keeping you awake.]]></description>
