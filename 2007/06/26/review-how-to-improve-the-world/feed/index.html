The bin of lights (sorry, name and artist escape me - it was next to the Jeremy Dellar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faireyband.com/acidbrass.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Acid Brass&lt;/a&gt; - get a listen it&#039;s fantastic - mind-map), almost looked like it was stuff that had been chucked out -   inspired hanging or not, you decide...
