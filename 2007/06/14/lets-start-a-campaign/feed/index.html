		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s less about directed complaining than of consciousness raising. Broad St, for example, is recognised as a zone where noise occurs late at night, so anyone buying a flat above a bar on Broad St would know up front exactly what they&#039;re getting into (and in some cases wouldn&#039;t be able to use it as a residence due to health restrictions).

Digbeth isn&#039;t recognized at an official level as an entertainment district. The reason it has become somewhere where live music occurs is because it&#039;s cheap and has a lot of Victorian-era pubs that aren&#039;t so busy in the evenings. I don&#039;t know for sure but I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s officially designated an industrial area that&#039;s undergoing regeneration into a learning / creative quarter, or whatever the current buzz-phrase is. 

What we need to do right now is make people aware that this is a concern so that the powers that be take this into consideration when they&#039;re thinking about the area. Closing down a pub because it&#039;s noisy is an easy move. Closing down a venue that brings life and money into an area is not. 

I ramble.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, photoshop images aside, to whom do we actually complain?  It appears that Clare Short is the MP for Digbeth High Street, but I imagine this would be more of a local council question.  Or would it?

Similarly, does &quot;I come over to your ends and spend a fair bit of money in the pubs, but I&#039;m not an actual constituent&#039; carry any weight?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve got my signature too. 

Let the Yuppies move on somewhere else, I&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be others waiting to take their place, whatever happpened to &quot;work hard play hard&quot; eh? they should be greatfull for all the noise, everyone else has to get night busses and taxi&#039;s to enjoy the noise.

And how much can they hear through the breezeblocks and double glazing anyway? Let them move out, let the prices drop and I&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be plenty of people, me for one who wouldn&#039;t mind a nice little apartment down Digbeth.]]></description>
