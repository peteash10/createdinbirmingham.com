		<description><![CDATA[Its ridiculous that this is happening in Digbeth (tho perhaps inevitable as has been said).  Its bad enough elsewhere in the city - there are few enough good venues around, without any being shut.

People are entitled to complain of course, but I guess its down to us - the creative types and music fans - to make our voices heard as well.  If politicians get a number of complaints, but not comments of support, in a way their hands are tied.

		<description><![CDATA[The sad thing is that this type of thing was more or less inevitable from the moment that it was announced Digbeth was being done up.

&#039;Eastside&#039; indeed.  It&#039;s a rare, rare day that &#039;redevelopment&#039; means anything other than &#039;gentrification&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately people also complain when they move into new developments near very long standing industrial areas.

People just don&#039;t seem to realise that &#039;noise&#039; - or life as others would describe it - it par of that &#039;city living&#039; that developers are pushing.

But then I live out in the country where people in new developments also complain about noise, i.e. sheep, cockerels etc and again completely miss the point of living in the location.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think we need a sticker campaign.

&lt;b&gt;&quot;Keep Digbeth Noisy&quot;&lt;/b&gt; 

Any sticker-monkeys want to take me up on that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you ever get the impression that the new residents just want the kudos for being able to drop the fact that they live in Digbeth into conversation, but actually don&#039;t have a clue what the area&#039;s about? If they want peace, then it&#039;s almost blindingly obvious that the &#039;burbs are best for that...

Keep Digbeth full of noise!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep,

It would be a shame if this happened. I live in Digbeth and have attended a residential meeting where new Digbethian residents- who obviously hadn&#039;t done enough research about their new habitat, complained about noise pollution during the early hours. 

I think the contractors are also to blame for cheaply buidling these new flats- the walls are paper thin!! 

Ear plugs!!! Cheap and allow for a good night&#039;s sleep.]]></description>
