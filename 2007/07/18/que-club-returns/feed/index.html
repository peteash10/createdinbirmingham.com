		<description><![CDATA[HARMONY 5th April 2008 QClub Birmingham Trouble 
 
HARMONY Hmm More like DIS-HARMONY 
 
People where do I start.So many basic things was wrong with this event you had to see it to believe it. The only good point was the police-present at the event, could of done more but if they were not there GOD knows what would have happened.
 
I was very apprehensive before this event, as I have been to many Garage events like TwiceAsNice @Club collossuem; Works (Kingston) &#038; The End, and BackTo95 @ministry of sound, back in the day. But I thought with such a Big Event being it Garage back in the day and knowing how trouble is usually connected with big garage events in the past and the amount it cost for tickets. That QClub and Harmony will make the effort of making sure this was an organised; professional &#038; Safe event. Unfortunately I discovered they were unprofessional and basically out of their depth :-O
 
NO Dress Code...What happened in making people make an effort shoes; no jeans; no sportswear rather than people looking like they have come from the local Youth centre just down the road? Having a smart Dress Code is a usual dress code that is used by many other clubs to deter possible trouble makers. But is no means full proof.
 
Even when they stated no hoods on flyer an tickets I saw loads of guys in the event wearing Hoods - Where was the discipline from Q-Club on the Door?
 
Last entry before 1am on ticket was a bad move, the event was supposed to finish at 6am. As I can imagine people must of thought OMG its fast approaching 1am hence an increase in trouble was inevitable and the locking OFF of the Event.
 
Longer line of Queuing gates to vastly reduced over crowding near the entrance was required. Had one guy old enough to be my Granddad trying to Hold part of the gates near the entrance, to try and stop the crowd rushing the door. Was this part of the security QClub were talking about?
 
Event started at 9pm yet people didn&#039;t get in until 11pm ...Shocking! 
Gone are the days when you have a big event and a club need to show off that they are having a big event by purposely delaying the Queue to entice people on road to pay on the door.  This only made the crowd in the queue more restless and further increased the frustration in the crowd with ongoing queue pushing.
 
Tickets were for over 18s (over 18s OMG) Did the promoters and Club have any history about the event in the past surely this should of been an over 23 event at least, if this was to be a true harmony event.
 
Whole thing was money making (Â£30 on the Door :-O please!)...We were duped, left right and sinker. Every person who went to this event should be refunded regardless if it was 3hrs or 5mins should be refunded (Found it strange how they didn&#039;t give you back the ticket stubs as proof of entry?) .
Went to get a drink J2O Â£3 and the food stand was selling Burger and chips for a shocking Â£6 am I in Birmingham Q-club or London&#039;s China White&#039;s nightclub?
Throw in Â£2 for the cloakroom for one item and you get the picture.
 
You have dumb bouncers telling the people who are getting crushed at the front to pushback 400  people who are pushing from behind, just silly.
 
Police watching standing and doing nothing for at least 15mins while people were getting crushed, girls screaming and a number of women crying. When the police finally stepped in it was far too late POOR! They had presents but no authority!
 
When I was the unlucky few to get in at 12:45am The place was embarrassingly empty, the search was very quick and thorough and I could NOT understand the hold up as usually in some venues the hold up is due to the cloakroom being near to the entrance, which usually builds up a Queue inside the venue hence causes delay outside the club. But the cloakroom was far away from the entrance on the 1st floor with no Queue so the delay outside was totally unnecessary.Must of been in the main room for no more than 25mins then the sound of the music decreases (then OFF) and the lights came on (I knew it was locked off from then). There were a couple of fights inside the Club and bouncers running like headless chickens at times. The bouncers soon ushered us to the exits doors and I asked one why has this event been locked off and he told me LIVE &quot;You See why when you see the shooter marks left outside&quot;. Lower behold when I got outside I saw the evidence, the Police swat team and the whole of corporation street sealed off and blocked off by the police and their vans etc.
 
Then the LONG Drive back to London, while it was pouring down with snow just made me MORE VEX! :-@
 
A big shame as a lot of people Seem to want to hear some classic garage tunes and were in the mood to rave hard to 6am
 
If you want the money then Harmony pay the security and Fix up (like dizzee rascal says) , as there is no doubt in my mind you put people&#039;s LIVES at risk for your lack of organisation and preparation. 
 
This event has done so much damage I doubt if it will ever make another comeback :-(

		<description><![CDATA[Truss me dere were shots poppin and not just once, we were outside for an hour from 11.30 everyone outside could hear them - thats why so many peeps walked away (the older ones with sense)especially when the ambulances &#038; dogs came

The clu is in the name it&#039;s HARMONY half these kidz dont even know bout Harmony back in the days or that it&#039;s strictly about raving.  
To be fair Q Club is partly to blame - why have a revolving door for a rave?? It&#039;s not the Hilton, obvious there was gonna be carnage when they were taking an excessively long time to get anyone through - it was snowing!!  No excuses for the yout that totally wrecked the night we&#039;d been waiting for tho. All outlets are refunding tho as Trading Standards has now got involved

		<description><![CDATA[Harmony was locked down at 1am, i was working there, we were locked in for a while as the streets were cleared outside...we heard rumours of people rushing the doors (taking ages to get folks thru security), and also of gunshots (i think this is probably bulls**t tho as no mention on the news).
Lets hope this night wont affect the clubs licence because we&#039;ve had some great house type nights on there recently, would be a shame to lose such a good venue.]]></description>
