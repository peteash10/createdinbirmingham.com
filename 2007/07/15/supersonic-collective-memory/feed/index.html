		<description><![CDATA[alas, 2007&#039;s SS was for me (and a few others) a bit of a let down compared to the previous year. Maybe it was the line up? The stand outs were OM, Pharaoh Overlord, Mogwai and a few others. OM were incredible. Pharaoh Overlord were good, but their set in Bradford the night before (1hour plus) was incredible. Mogwai were just boring. Couple that with horrible queues (a reminder of last xmas&#039;s ATP), horrific beer prices, and the rude guy &#039;guarding&#039; the merch floor all contributed to an uneasy feeling about the whole event. Which is a shame, as I believe Capsule are doing amazing things. Maybe next year will bring a better line up, and a different approach to the problems mentioned. Cheers.]]></description>
