		<description><![CDATA[Don`t miss it! I volunteered during the festival last year; had a great time, met some fantastic people (including artists and influential contacts).  This year I`m exhibiting at the festival and am about to be added to the Rhubarb Farm, the festival promises to be bigger and better than ever and Curzon St Station is the perfect venue.  Hope to see you guys there!]]></description>
