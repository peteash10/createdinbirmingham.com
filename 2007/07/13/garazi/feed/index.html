		<description><![CDATA[Garazi was one of my close friends through university! I am a photographer myself and looking at her work which seems to have exploaded into something quite brilliant the last couple of years! i can say that her photography displays every bit of her and of personality the vibrant and bold colours and subjects will always get a response and reaction and in my opinion to do that makes a great photographer! All the best Garazi sweetheart!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Garazi&#039;s great. 

She was a photography student at UCE a couple of years back, and we know some of the same people -- including Alana (red hair, tattoos on the left), wife of James aka &#039;Spoons&#039; of buscast fame (now living in Australia).

You might also like Ellie Gibbons -- who&#039;s just gone through the course and takes some sensational shots. A quick Google turns up a Fotix account.

Julian Kilsby, who runs the course, can take some of the credit here. His site is: http://www.jmkphoto.co.uk/]]></description>
