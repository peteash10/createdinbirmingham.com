		<description><![CDATA[DJ Limb: I&#039;m already, two days in, thinking a forum might be useful. And I &lt;i&gt;really hate&lt;/i&gt; forums. 

Robin: In Dom&#039;s defense he very good at combining snazzy design and usability from the off. While I don&#039;t hold the purse strings I&#039;d be happy to hire him to do the design, once we have an idea what sort of design is needed. 

Russ: You do know who you&#039;re talking to, right? There will be no pointless animations on my watch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Be realistic, Dom. Do you want a website as Art, or as an information serivce? Dangerously brilliant and edgy innovative sites that tick all the boxes - they&#039;re a pain to navigate and lengthy to load. I want Custard Factory info. This is a good start. Far better to do the basics right and build up to the fancy stuff later.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[May as well add my post here too...

Good to see the new Custard Factory site up and hear about all the future plans for the site like the company directory, events listings etc. Iâ€™m sure the content will be top notch.

But the styling needs a whole lot of work. Currently the design doesnâ€™t reflect the place in anyway and has the potential to discredit all the good work going into the content.

I would like the Custard Factory to re-ignite the vibrancy of itâ€™s past. This site is a step in the right direction but could do with some proper design clout to compliment the content.]]></description>
