		<description><![CDATA[WOIB mostly lists club events and live music but there are intentions of spending more time in compiling theatre, comedy and exhibitions in Birmingham. Most of the club events and live music listings are listed by the promoters themselves making the task of keeping it all up to date a bit easier but I do try to cover the whole scene.

What&#039;s On In Brum? receives around 20,000 - 30,000 hits a week either from people knowing about the site or through Google.

If you haven&#039;t checked the site out please do: http://www.woib.co.uk

A new version was launched this week and so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Considering the amount of money that has been poured into the likes of Birminghamusic.com (as an example)shouldn&#039;t somebody somewhere be taking an interest in finding out why so much money has been spent but so little has been achieved that has proved actually useful in the long term? I get the feeling that &quot;Feel the Heat&quot; is just the tip of the iceberg that has taken a slap because the problem is more deep rooted than just the &quot;feel the heat&quot; campaign. I fear that Feel the heat was &quot;the last straw&quot; or a &quot;catalyst&quot; that has stimulated heated discussion...and that it&#039;s not just &quot;feel the heat&quot; that needs to be called to account. What about the likes of Artsfest, Creative launchpad, Creative Insight, Creative Alliance, Creative College in the Community, LSC and Gigbeth, Creative Networks, how can these projects be evaluated properly to identify clear demonstration of best practice versus potential waste of time money and resources. Is there an effective form of evaluation and what lessons can be learned? I can&#039;t believe all of them are &quot;huge Successes&quot; and I&#039;m sure at least one of them must be demonstrating best practice. How do we find out?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[we all aim to please...

but seriously, if dave, jamie, or anybody else would like a custom rss feed from birmingham alive to enhance their own listings sites, i&#039;d be more than willing to oblige.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are NO websites that show EVERYTHING IN BIRMINGHAM that can be watched, listened to, enjoyed, participated in etc etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

that&#039;s right; i don&#039;t deny it - but if anybody can point to a site which has a more comprehensive picture of live performance in birmingham, i&#039;ll willingly concede.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for a very enjoyable, if not heated, debate on the Birmingham event scene. It&#039;s a shame that the ArtsFest organisers didn&#039;t have that fire in their bellies and passion to promote their event this year! Well done, very entertaining.
