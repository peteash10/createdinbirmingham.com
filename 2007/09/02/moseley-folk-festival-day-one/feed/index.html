		<description><![CDATA[Moseley Folk Fest

I have to agree, indeed a seminal event. 

I have to say that it is quite possibly the best organised festival I have attended in years and although on a smaller scale, comparable to Cambridge Folk Fest in every way. All credit to the team and the staff who were well informed and helpful.

The line up was superb and stalls had a good variety of food and fest-nicknacks.

Well done Gerv and all concerned.

If you weren&#039;t there...you really missed out on something very special right here in Birmingham.]]></description>
