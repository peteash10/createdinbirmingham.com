		<description><![CDATA[birmingham polytechnic university was actually one of the original options back in 1992, but was rejected on the grounds that they wanted to get away from the second class (as described by others - me, i&#039;m proud of the fact that i enrolled at birmingham *school of music* at the *city of birmingham* polytechnic, not these jonny-come-lately imposters) image of former polys.

if they were to follow the chinese model, would that mean the university based down in edgbaston &#038; bournbrooke would become birmingham normal university ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was all for Birmingham Osbourne University myself, and suggested it only half-jokingly. It has a nice ring. A colleague suggested Birmingham Polytechnic University, which tells it like it is at least. Hong Kong Polytechnic University seems to do pretty well, and the change is certainly targeted overseas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Back in 1992 they wanted to be Birmingham XXXX University but Birmingham and Aston would block it in the Privy Council (i was a student at the Poly at the time and was told this a lecturer) so they opted for the vague UCE name.

To be honest i am surprised it got through now without opposition by Brum Uni (i hear that Tidmarsh got assurance beforehand there would not be any opposition before he submitted the name to the Privy Council) but times change. 

The UCE Birmingham rebrand was a mistake and gave us a name and logo that looked like we made computer consumables or something.]]></description>

I remember it used to be known as The University of Central England in Birmingham. They obviously did want to let people know it was in Birmingham although it was a bit of a mouthful. 

Then it got changed to UCE Birmingham. Here&#039;s a bit of inside info: They didn&#039;t like this name because it didn&#039;t include the word &#039;University.&#039; 

Suddenly, they renamed it to something that included the words &#039;University&#039; and &#039;Birmingham.&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chamberlain already has fairly strong ties to UB/UoB (as they now appear to be known!) - he was the first Chancellor, and also has the main clock tower and a hall of residence named after him, as well as a large collection of original manuscripts and papers in the main library from all three Chamberlains.

Hence UB might not have been best pleased with the creation of a Birmingham Chamberlain University.

Birmingham Skinner University anyone?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I love the way the equally non-descript â€˜BCUâ€™ acronym has effortlessly replaced â€˜UCEâ€™

That&#039;s just it, the full name is too long to use and the individual parts are difficult to use alone without confusion. People in Brum will end up calling it City University (which despite the nice repeating &#039;word&#039; isn&#039;t going to help recognition). 

It&#039;ll be interesting to see how it develops. I hope whoever is monitoring the change let&#039;s us in on how it goes six-months down the line.]]></description>
