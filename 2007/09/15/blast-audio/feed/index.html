		<description><![CDATA[in a similar vein, here&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=DX7IzMTbh7w&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;four odd minutes of poor quality footage&lt;/a&gt; of tonight&#039;s Blast. Terrible compression, some people talking in the background, it&#039;s up with some of Gimpo&#039;s shots of the KLF burning that million pounds in terms of a inadequate record of spectacular arts.

There were loads of people with proper cameras, and tripods and everything, but this might do until that stuff surfaces.

Just as good for a second time btw.]]></description>
