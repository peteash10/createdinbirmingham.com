		<description><![CDATA[To whom this may concern
 
We are BA Contemporary Crafts students in our final year. As part of our preparation for our graduation we are preparing our business proposal. Our company name is &#039;Forgotten/Found&#039; and we are planning to work form a studio to produce a range of home wear. Products will be crafted from individually sourced vintage fabrics, so as to bring new life to forgotten fabrics. Our aim is to recycle found fabrics into beautiful, embellished pieces for peoples homes. We will start by producing cushions to get a name for ourselves and then develop our company by producing new products such as lampshades and furniture. 
 
We are considering our options for retail, and realize that trade fairs are a very good opportunity to create awareness of our company and products, and could increase our clientele. We would greatly appreciate any information you would be able to provide us concerning exhibiting at Flair Designer Maker Fair and how we might go about this.
 
Many Thanks for your time
Yours Faithfully
