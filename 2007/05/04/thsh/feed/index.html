		<description><![CDATA[The question of ownership interests me.  Was Symphony Hall merely &#039;managed&#039; by the NEC group before?  I&#039;d always assumed they actually owned it.  By similar token, if Performances Birmingham LTD &#039;manages and runs&#039; the two venues then who do they actually belong to?  NEC group, the council, or whom?  It&#039;s not necessarily going to make a huge difference to me, but the evasive language used definitely leads me to wonder.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Josh: Hmm. That&#039;s still not exactly clear in my mind but I&#039;m not sure it really matters.

Bounder: I was thinking more about my impression of the venue, not what it actually does. It now SEEMS a lot more interesting, even if it used to be just as interesting before!

Amusing aside: the top Google result for THSH is currently the wonderfully named &quot;Tannenbaum Helpern Syracuse &amp; Hirschtritt&quot; law firm. Can I get that on a t-shirt?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Much as I hate the NEC/NIA experience, Symphony Hall does have some top stuff - I&#039;ve seen Morrissey, Bjork, Ray Davies and even Vic Reeves there - in a great and fairly intimate venue.

I hope the Town Hall develops slightly differently - the opportunity to have standing gigs should make for a better atmosphere. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;ll become like a smaller and more architecturally pleasing Wolverhampton Civic Hall.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to clarify things... Symphony Hall is no longer being managed by NEC Group (although they are still handling the ticketing for the time being).

A new organisation has been created, Performances Birmingham Ltd,  to run both Symphony Hall and Town Hall. More at http://www.thsh.co.uk/page/performances-birmingham-ltd/]]></description>
