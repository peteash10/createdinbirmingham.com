		<description><![CDATA[This was a fantastic event, excellent quality art, crafts, jewellery, textiles, ceramics, glass and music complimented by a beautiful sunny day. Great gallery events and a bus to transport us around all the activiites, the children loved it too. Thank you to all the organisers and stall holders - it had a wonderful day. Please hold another one!]]></description>
