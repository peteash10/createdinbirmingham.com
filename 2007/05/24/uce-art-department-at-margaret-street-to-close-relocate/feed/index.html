		<description><![CDATA[It is an unbelievably glorious art school and art as an activity of a civilised society was extolled by the Victorian city patrons who dedicated the school; one of the first provincial schools of art in Britain. I attended there and would like to see the building employed as an art museum extension. Visual arts in Britain and Europe has become more exciting in the last twenty years thanks to imaginative curatorship and large scale developments such as Tate Modern. Liverpool enjoys an extension of the Tate. So I think Birmingham deserves a more modern museum too. A lot of works simply are locked in museum basements. Well, Birmingham needs a new public attraction in it&#039;s city center. It may also include fashion and photography, and also commercial design and arhitecture, craft history video installation and lots of travelling exhibitions can easily be hosted there. And also a cafeteria can be very easily fitted in as well as concert hall.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To reassure everybody and to end speculation, at present, as far as we are concerned working in the building, they are not going to sell the Margaret Street site. Certainly it has been a marketing and publicity blunder of spectacular proportions, seeminghly unaware of how strong the voice would be in protest, and how much the building is valued as a purpose built centre of creative practice. It would seem, however,that sense has prevailed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not only will Margaret Street being relocated but Bournville Centre for Visual Arts, which is where there are two beautiful buildings in the heart of Bournville village.
Many years of students have completed their foundation course and completely enjoyed the experience and expertise of the staff who have taught them. Its a crying shame that the students from both buildings will have to merge with thousands more other students at either eastside or perry barr and will not benefit from getting what they consider is a valuable life experience, forget about the money and think about whats best 
for the students.]]></description>

it&#039;s not only stupid flogging off a historic building to move elsewhere (to somewhere which will no doubt have a shelf life of 40 years max, like the paradise circus complex), but also seems like a shocking waste of money given it seems like only in the last few years that uce spent an awful lot of money on renovating the building to make it even more effective as an art college than it was before.

at least the proposed conservatoire (which again has had an awful lot of money spent on it over the last 15 years) move will be the result of a compulsory purchase order, so it won&#039;t be quite such a waste.]]></description>
