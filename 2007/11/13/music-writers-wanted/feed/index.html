		<description><![CDATA[Freelance Writer for Hire!

I am currently taking on further paid freelance assignments. At present, I contribute material to a number of magazines and websites as a freelance writer. I have a solid reputation for providing consistent, quality web content in the form of articles, reviews, interviews and blog entries. http://musicandmedia.wordpress.com/references/

The bulk of my contributions have been made as a freelance music reviwer, examples of which can be found via the links in the â€™musicâ€™ category of my portfolio at: http://musicandmedia.wordpress.com/category/music/

I have also contributed material on various topics including current affairs, technology and, in particular, short humour (reference the â€˜lifeâ€™ category in my portfolio at http://musicandmedia.wordpress.com/category/life/)..

For more information about myself, please visit my &#039;about&#039; page at: http://musicandmedia.wordpress.com/about/

Direct links to published material may be found via my main page, along with a link to my myspace profile page.

So, if youâ€™re looking for writers at the moment and you think my style and format would suit, please feel free to contact me.
