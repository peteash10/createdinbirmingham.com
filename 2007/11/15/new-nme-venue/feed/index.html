		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The venue is run by people from Birmingham&quot; 
excellent news

&quot;the promoter of the Club NME night is from&quot; Birmingham, 
excellent news

&quot;and most of the bands playing will be from Birmingham.&quot; 
excellent news

&quot;NME donâ€™t run the nights themselves and have no connection to the venue.&quot;
even better.

does that mean you will be removing all references to &quot;NME&quot; and perhaps replace it with something to do with the people who run it, the people its going to benefit or something that also has NOTHING TO DO with &quot;NME&quot;?

or am I just stupid and thinking that the name is somehow connected with NME when you just have a similar name in mind?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, it&#039;s nothing to do with NME. It&#039;s the same people opening it who run the Sunflower Lounge. It sounds like it&#039;s slightly higher capacity than the Sunny and could be a good venue for large small bands. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing that it&#039;s like.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh well, we all get what we deserve and what a triumph the arrival of another &quot;Branded&quot; venue will be. Creative Birmingham, Birmingham The Creative City, Be in Birmingham, is now ......Birmingham the &quot;other peoples Brands&quot; city. Birmingham is clearly giving way to &quot;someone else&#039;s Brand&quot; who can do it better. Ha ha. Don&#039;t you just love the clear sustainable creative economy all this funding is providing us all with?

Thanks LSC, Thanks AWM, Thanks Birmingham City Council. You&#039;re doing a great Job.

Sorry what was the date again? February 7th? 
No you&#039;re wrong....the date sponsored by a brand that is neither a resident nor a connected business of the West Midlands is: February 7th.

You idiots.

See you at the bar counting out two pence pieces, I can&#039;t wait for this one.]]></description>
