		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t mind the screen, I object to that white monstrosity behind it â€“ Aghhh! out with the imperialist civic propagandist architecture and in with the ugly utility living.

The content must change and so too must the subliminal advertising and civic brainwashing slogans broadcast with every 7th frame.

In case you havenâ€™t noticed them, One says &quot;Stay calm, don&#039;t panic. The council have taken control of your life and usual service will never resume&quot;

The other one says &quot;Go to work! Shut up! Don&#039;t question! Don&#039;t complain! Consume Consume, Consume and be happy!&quot;

So all in all no wonder they fiddled the paperwork again.

		<description><![CDATA[I am not a fan of the big screen either. Don&#039;t we all watch enough telly anyway?

I was based in BMAG when it first went up and frequently needed to close the windows when the noise of Neighbours of some other daytime TV fluff made it&#039;s way through.

Having said that I have worked on some community pojects were screenings of participants work has been shown on the screen and this has been very powerful for them, but still doesn&#039;t require 24 by 7 TV the rest of the time. 

I find it generally very intrusive especially as it was housed in one of the Birmingham&#039;s few architecturally grand and arguably beautiful spots (as long as u don&#039;t turn to face the library (which I also like incidentally for its Brutalists ways).]]></description>
