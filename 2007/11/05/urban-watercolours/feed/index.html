		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pete.
Just to add to your piece on Arthur Lockwood&#039;s book - which is excellent and will be on my pressie list for Christmas - that if purchased from the RBSA gallery in Brook St, a donation of Â£2 will go to the RBSA from every sale.

Thanks again for your input on blogs today at Creative Alliance which will hopefully give me added impetus to tend to my own website more regularly!]]></description>
