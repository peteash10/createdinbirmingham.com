		<description><![CDATA[From their &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=13068879&amp;blogID=328062034&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And then the gig I&#039;d been looking forward to the most. The Birmingham Retail Turning On Of The Xmas Lights with The Sugababes and McFly! That&#039;s right readers, I got to say to 10000 people, &quot;McFly up next&quot;! It was very funny. I&#039;ve got a feeling the sound was terrible, but I really didn&#039;t care, you&#039;ve got to appreciate these moments in time! I nicked a McFly plectrum and Lucy the sax player got her photo taken with The Chipmunks. Meanwhile Lucy the piano player was pouring rotting milk we&#039;d found in the car down the sink of the backstage toilets whilst the Sugababes were putting on their make-up. We couldn&#039;t fit in if we tried! We finished our set with our anti money spending song Hey Man!&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
