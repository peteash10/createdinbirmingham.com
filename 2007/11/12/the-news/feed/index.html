		<description><![CDATA[This Independent Shops...is something I and many others have been continuously saying for years at different steering groups, committees, set up by the many different agencies. It goes hand in hand with the cultural and creative industries and cant and shouldnt be separated, there is almost no point, culturally or economically in the city producing fantastic talent (which we do, no matter what anyone thinks) in the various art-cultural sectors if there is no outlet for this talent to showcase and sell their work. Where can young fashion designers, jewelery makers, artists etc sell their work? Birmingham has a once in a lifetime opportunity right now in placing this at the centre of the continued regeneration of the city centre, you only have to walk outside of the Bullring to see the amount of brilliant retail space available. High St-New St-Dale (Stale?) End should be stuffed with indy bars, restaurants, retail shops and the like. It would bring this area to life  and keep it lifelike after 6pm and would offer a great alternative to the endless High St stores. There is a way to make this happen have BCC got the foresight to make it a reality? (Sorry for the long rant!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too met Mary Portas last Friday. She had some interesting things to say but I think most of us already know that a much needed boost is required to help independent retailers change Birmingham from a &#039;clone&#039; of other cities. And if it takes someone like Mary to say it for the council to see then hopefully it makes a difference.]]></description>
