		<description><![CDATA[Pete, I understand your inner conflict, after years of sites coded for IE. Yes, surely the advantage of mobile Safari is that it works with regular websites, not ones coded especially. However it&#039;s hard to argue when a bit of optimisation results in a site as lovely as Simon&#039;s: usable on any standard browser and perfect for the palm of your hand.

He should dump the regular site and make his iPhone site his &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; site.]]></description>
