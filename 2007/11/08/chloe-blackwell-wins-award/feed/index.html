		<description><![CDATA[Would like to give both Gigbeth and National Express a big credit for having the energy and vision to stage this event.  It sounded like the most unlikely location for a concert but ... it really did work well!  Don&#039;t get to Birmingham very often - but that&#039;s going to change for sure.  The Gigbeth experience over the 3 days was bang on!  I gigged until my feet were shouting for help .. and some of the &#039;seminars&#039; were really useful.  Met a load of great people and definitely coming back next year.  Rock on you Brummies ... who needs to go to London?]]></description>
