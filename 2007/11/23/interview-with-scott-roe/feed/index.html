		<description><![CDATA[No I&#039;m Mikhail Alexandrovich! 

To set the record straight:
Mark Badger is the name that Mikhail Alexandrovich has been using for the purposes of commenting on items on this blog. Itâ€™s a name that would be the equivalent of Andrei Rublev or Grigori Yefimovich Rasputinâ€¦if you lived in Birmingham. Itâ€™s also the name of a character in a film called Directors in Crisis who complain all the time and don&#039;t take too well to people trying to offer help instead of money. You might understand why I chose that name to comment here if you watch the film. At the request of Pete and in the interests of clear and transparent interaction, I will now use Mikhail Alexandrovich.

and who is Mikhail Alexandrovich? Me. Iâ€™m Mikhail, I run an independent record label called Iron Curtain Records, which is based in Pokrovskoye, Tyumen Oblast. The record label has been running since 1996 and in 2000 I set up the Communist Music Network which is also known as just Official Citizens Music Network 7005689. Iâ€™ve organised gigs in and around yumen Oblast since the October Revolution as Bolshevik Promotions. I play in a band called ÐŸÐ¾ÑÐ»ÐµÐ´Ð½Ð¸Ð¹ ÐŸÐ¾Ð´ Ð¡Ð¾Ð»Ð½Ñ†ÐµÐ¼ and at present Iâ€™m also playing guitar in another Bolshevik based band called Ð¿Ð¾Ð»Ð¸Ñ†ÐµÐ¹ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÑƒÐ±Ð»ÑŽÐ´Ð¾Ðº, who have recently re-formed. I do a bit of tour management and driving to help bands out, write and maintain several music related blogs, and recently started to look after a band called The Orbâ€¦but only as far as their online activities are concerned. I do some lecturing at Moscow State Circus as part of their Music Business degree course. I run a shop on ebay selling all sorts of good alternative music on cd or vinyl. I also enjoy a good game of mental chess with local funding organisations who try and pocket most of the money intended for struggling local musicians and creatives. Thats about it really.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dunno, isn&#039;t &quot;appropriate&quot; quite a subjective and loaded term? What&#039;s appropriate for one person might be deeply inappropriate for another. If there was a form of funding that everyone found appropriate it&#039;d probably be so bogged down in compromise that it&#039;d be next to useless. 

And I read â€œInappropriate use of funding on a yearly basisâ€¦â€ as meaning the system of dolling out cash on a calendar, where specific sums have to be spent by specific dates to ensure the next round of cash isn&#039;t cut, often regardless of the quality of the project/etc being spent on, is fundamentally flawed. And I&#039;m sure no-one would disagree but this isn&#039;t specific to the Arts/music/etc world. It goes on at every level of government.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[on the subject of &quot;Inappropriate use of funding on a yearly basis...&quot; anyone going to kick the ball and start listing some examples of &quot;Inappropriate uses of funding&quot; and perhaps balance it with some positive suggestions on what the funding perhaps could have been used more effectively on / with / etc if a second chance was offered??

Anyone got a list of examples of good practice or examples of &quot;appropriate&quot; uses of funding?

I think its time that some funding mistakes are openly admitted and a discussion about what positive policy ideas or new ideas / strategies could ensure more &quot;appropriate use&quot; of said funds....??

Is anyone aware of inappropriate use of funding or is Scott the only one who knows what&#039;s actually been going on behind the scenes all this time?]]></description>
