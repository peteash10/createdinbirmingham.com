		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t actually attend any of Gigbeth as I was away with Dufus but I found this link to a blog that refers in a light hearted way to some of the discussions that took place as part of the the Conference. Joking aside I think it raises some quite important issues. Pete, you&#039;ll have to make a decision on whether you want to include it or not but I think it should go under some heading of constructive Criticism or something.

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting to hear about the security - we worked pretty hard to brief them so it is is useful to know that it didn&#039;t work completely. The shared events with other promoters at the med bar didn&#039;t work from our point of view either - but we have good relationships with those promoters now and will try to do full Gigbeth based events with them next year to avoid the confusion....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Overall I was pretty disappointed with Gigbeth. From a punters point of view I found the security very heavy handed seeing one wasted (but causing no trouble) chap ejected from the Kerryman for (shock) dancing! And being told I couldn&#039;t enter the Sanctuary because it was closed even though the final act had just started and surely would be playing for at least 30mins.

Couple that with events which were falsely advertised on the flyers as part of the event but actually were separate with additional separate costs.

Finally, just the apathy of Birmingham again raising it&#039;s head with half filled venues and events becoming empty before they&#039;d finished.

Shame - could have been great. Maybe next year.]]></description>
