		<description><![CDATA[If you miss the Acid Mother&#039;s Temple gig or just fancy a day of quality music this weekend Einstellung are very proud to be playing in Oxford on Saturday 10th as part of the Audioscope all day festival. Headlining the charity event in aid of Shelter are  krautrock founding fathers MICHAEL ROTHER (Neu!, Kraftwerk, Harmonia) &#038; DIETER MÃ–BIUS (Cluster, Harmonia) other bands include SHIT AND SHINE, THE SEA AND CAKE and ROTHKO www.audioscope.co.uk

Einstellung on stage at 2.45pm

Playing a Birmingham gig with Capsule the night before has enabled us to keep the cost for the Shelter gig to an minimum which means more money goes to John Peel&#039;s favourite charity.

btw - Tot has been awarded single of the month by Subba Cultcha webzine.]]></description>
