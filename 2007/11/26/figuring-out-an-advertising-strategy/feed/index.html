		<description><![CDATA[A slight aside but could I ask for a bit more info on Creative Republic...all seems a bit mysterious at the moment and their also seems to be a slight confusion about what is the West Midlands and what is Birmingham...would be good to hear a little more about what it is, what it&#039;s trying to do and how organisations get involved in it all...
Aside from that this all sounds good in terms of a sustainable and non-intrusive way of funding a great resource for those in the city...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think thats the problem, &quot;if the budget was there&quot;
the reason this blog has been invaluable is because you have covered all sorts of events/exhibitions regardless of size. For many of us smaller independent organisations we don&#039;t have a marketing budget and it would be a shame that those with larger budgets get prioritised. I think that this blog has a good case to get continued support from funders as its probably the most used and useful creative website in the region. Thats just my two pence worth:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t have Bearded advertise through the site but that&#039;s only because all the money we have goes on the magazine.

I do think that your ethos is right though in the sense that you only want ads that complement the site and I personally wouldn&#039;t mind nicely placed ads regardless of their usefulness. Also the blog is pretty interactive in the fact that plenty of people from throughout the creative community in Birmingham comment on here regularly. I think that would encourage people to advertise.

The readership of the blog is easy to pinpoint and I see no reason why people wouldn&#039;t want to advertise local creative events to local creatives. Whether they would pay Â£50 for the privilege is another matter, I personally would certainly consider advertising the latest issue of Bearded here (if the budget was there).]]></description>
