		<description><![CDATA[Hi all, just so you know - I came from a meeting where this was raised with some senior people who have the influence to do something about this. Nothing promised, but in general a very positive meeting about the assistance the council other public and private organisations can give and where it could be best directed. I&#039;ll keep Pete posted about anything I hear about this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here we go again!

It&#039;s not the first time that our regions cultural heritage has been overlooked in the rush to reinvent Birmingham as a giant car park interspersed with ugly architectural loft house living.

I was fortunate to have been one of the last people to work in Curzon Street Station when I was graphic artists for Prince&#039;s Trust.

It was and is a beautiful building (with a staircase that leaves Vertigo sufferers clinging to the walls â€“ as I did each morning) and one of the few remaining treasures we have. What better purpose for it than to house creative art based events. Or even permanent exhibitions if our regions council and developers could see fit to invest in the cultural aspects of our society rather than corporate and consumer.

It has been empty and boarded for years on and off since I left from my brief spell there, but what is needed here is a clear Civic strategy to save it from becoming prime office space or apartments in the future and depriving future generations of the pleasure of great architecture and interiors. Or maybe that is the long term plan...again?

Can we get it right for a change?

PS â€“ Ken did you study at Bournville?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised at the shortsightedness of this - considering the station&#039;s proximity to Millennium Point, Think Tank and the burgeoning activity in Digbeth. Do you get the impression that some people think that because a building is old and utilitarian (even in this case if it is rather grandiose too) that it must be worthless? I assume it&#039;s a listed building. I hope it is.

And, the trouble with boarding things up is that all too often they become subject to suspicious fires and ultimately have to be demolished. That may not happen in this case - after all it&#039;s not a grand old pub with fat corporate chain hovering above it.]]></description>
