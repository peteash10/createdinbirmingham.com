		<description><![CDATA[Hey :) Just goes to show that nothing&#039;s ever really new and it&#039;s really great to share experiences.  So thanks for the links to Jonathan Shaw!  When I first modded my camera I was thinking of the the famous Henri Lartigue racing car image, but since then I discovered a number of others doing similar things including http://www.rit.edu/~andpph/text-slit-scan.html
and also
http://www.diyphotographics.ik.com/
Have fun and best wishes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These look great. It&#039;s worth looking at http://www.jonathan-shaw.com for a similar approach. Jon&#039;s been working with these techniques for the best part of 10 years now and has created some amazing work over that time. Crazy stretching and extremely long photos... still movies - great stuff!!]]></description>
