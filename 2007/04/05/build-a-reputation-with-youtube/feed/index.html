		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention Pete. As Leon has already mentioned, you&#039;re quite right in saying that in the run up to the first event we were all pretty much consumed by making it happen.

This time around, we are planning for an event in November and we intend to make much more use of this type of communication.

Ive already started blogging in the written word over at http://www.projectxpresents.com/blog and we hope follow this up with a series of video blogs - probably one from each main participant, highlighting just what the event means to them personally, so together offering a nice full picture of what we&#039;re up to.

We might also include some more general bulletins.

We&#039;ve always planned to be &quot;open source&quot; about what we do - initially as much as anything because of a genuine desire to share whatever useful experience we gain, but also to create community and we&#039;re starting to realise how powerful a tool for marketing and pr it is too.

		<description><![CDATA[yeah it was i did the video that was part of the performance and as you rightly say, i defintely was too busy for the whole week, generally 10am til 4am! there was a crew that documented the show, and i guess it was difficult to capture the true spirit of it in the same way it was to describe to your friends. for what it&#039;s worth it is here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5K35jLbkGU]]></description>
