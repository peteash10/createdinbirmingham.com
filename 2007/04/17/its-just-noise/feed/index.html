		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pete,

You may already know that sadly Noise Noise Allore are no more, I spoke to their bass player recently and he told me that himself and Biff have formed a new band called Bee Stung Lips, he also told me that Noise Noise Allore DIDNT record anything! What a travesty eh! Do you know if anyone ever recorded one of their gigs? I can&#039;t believe they&#039;ve disappeared without any evidence of their existence, sad eh? 

Best Regards
