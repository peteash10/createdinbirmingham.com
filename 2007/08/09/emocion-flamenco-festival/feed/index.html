		<description><![CDATA[My friends Guibert de Nogent, Dame Flora F Bucket and Brigadier Anthony Spunk-Hamilton and I have tried for days to book tickets for the final night of this festival.  It appears to be right up Spunk&#039;s alley!

Unfortunately, none of us have been able to contact the Town Hall&#039;s Box Office - &quot;it&#039;s always bu**ering engaged&quot; Dame F Bucket said.  I too tried to book today but also found it engaged.  Surely they should have call waiting facilities -but apparently not.

Also, Birmingham Town Hall seems to be the ONLY venue in the world that charges you EXTRA to book online.  Don&#039;t you just love Art strategies like this?  Perhaps you agree that internet bookers should pay more - I agree, some of them are sad nerds.  I&#039;d have booked anyway as money os no obhect for me bit the Brigadier siad he&#039;d &quot;be blowed&quot; of he&#039;d pay extra.

Has anyone else been lucky enough to secure tickets?  Or, are you too experiencing difficulties with the newly refurbished (at the cost of Â£22 quintilian of our council tax money) Birmingham Town Hall?]]></description>
