		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say thanks to all the folks who came to Likemind - yes, it was at 8am but I have to say, there wasn&#039;t a bleary eye in the house! 

We had all sorts of people attend, from sectors as diverse as architecture, business, design, education, journalism and public health. All very diverse and interesting, I thought.

The next Likemind&#039;ll be 21st September, 8am at Hudson&#039;s Colmore Row. So, I hopefully even more new faces will pop in for coffee and chat.]]></description>
