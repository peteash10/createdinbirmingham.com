		<description><![CDATA[Look guys.
The band sold 90% of their sales via consecutive sim card numbers. I think its around 1% of those were actually redeemed. So no one was downloading the track AT ALL.
If you want to cheat then don&#039;t be surprised if you get caught.
And if you are naive to think ANYONE believes that you were buying box loads of Sim Cards to &quot;Sell at gigs.&quot; Even though no actual people who arent made up internet names can confirm this, then you deserve the press raping that you are getting. You bought them to do buy backs, no one is is that stupid.
And if you do get caught, take it like men for gods sakes]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s all politics.  The big record labels arent making money from unsigned acts in the charts.  The last thing they want is in two or three years time half of the top 40 chart being independant acts.  How many other bands have been in the same situation as midas without us knowing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[innovation is a terrible thing. The OCC&#039;s silence just incriminates their motives further. I&#039;ve heard red shoes, in fact ive heard it live at the Shiny toy guns gig in birmingham. That band have got some potential make no mistake. Viva Machine were ace too, support bands stealing the night there.

		<description><![CDATA[Its a Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery inside an Enigma

I have trawled the net in search of information and there is some out there, including reference to the Music Week feature on the band and their innovative approach. 

A brilliant solution, fans still have to buy the music - just in a different way and it gives a good unsigned independant band chance to create a few ripples.

What ever the thinking judging by the HMV Instore response I still can not fathom why the track was pulled? Without doubt Midas are a very popular band with some cracking tunes. HMV (London) unsigned band of the week along with headlining and supporting a number of sold out gigs in the run up to the release and with a 3 month pre-order period its not surprising that they were set to better than charting at 59 with Dont Dance?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just seen the linkback post on Dubber&#039;s site. As a friend of mine pointed out, digital media is moving at a very fast rate, and the various societies out there who try and play gamekeeper will always be one step behind the poacher. It&#039;s interesting to note that the tracks weren&#039;t loaded onto sim cards - I actually purchased one myself at a gig. The sim card is preloaded with enough credit to make a purchase via SMS, by texting &quot;redshoes&quot; to 78789, from which you then get a link sent back so you can download the track on your PC on the day the track is release. Complicated - yes! Ingenious - yes! It convinced me to buy the tracks then and there at a gig, which I probably wouldn&#039;t have done otherwise (for no other reason than I didn&#039;t have enough credit on my phone!!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Pete,

Sometimes the timed blog posts work in your favour too. I wrote the whole &#039;the charts are rubbish&#039; thing (along with that whole series of &#039;things that are still true about music&#039; posts) nearly two weeks ago, before I went off on a trip around the country and popped off to Shambala.

The idea was that I&#039;d get a couple of days grace when I got back to collect my thoughts, and that I could start blogging live again on Monday.

It just so happened that I learned about the Midas thing last night, a full day before that post was due to go live. Good timing.

I had originally scheduled it to appear at 6pm this evening, in order to pick up the weekend readers, but once I&#039;d added on all the stuff about the Midas debacle, I moved it forward to about 5am so I could pre-empt everyone else (ta-dah!) without moving the posts too close together.

And then, I get all the extra bonus of your brilliant, insightful and just-wrong-enough-to-gain-traction comments so I can spin it out to a premium linkbaiting post, rather than simply a minor part of a little series.

Playing with the release dates: ah, it&#039;s all so cynical and calculating...]]></description>
