		<description><![CDATA[Matt Geary, Ben Drummond and Vijay produce some of the best music to come out of Birmingham in a long while. Terrific song writers and musicians yet its still the bands that get the write ups. Lets give the solo performers more credit.
Its got to be harder going it alone than with a band.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s pretty cr*p that with less than a week to go there&#039;s nothing on the council website and the artsfest website still does not have the full lineup confirmed. Some people like to make plans in advance so it would be good to know who is playing on Friday night. I read somewhere that OCS will be headlining but wondered if anyone good will be on beforehand. I was tempted by a flyer for the Beat at the Hare and Hounds on Friday but their website was equally unhelpful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no idea.  I don&#039;t read the Birmingham Post.

Irrespective of what it may or may not be partnered with, I still can&#039;t the little (big) bleeder in my pocket.  This is not a positive feature of a guide that one will be carrying around all day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the size that Birmingham Post pull-outs always are isn&#039;t it? So that would be a commercial &#039;partnership&#039; decision of some &quot;uncommonly cretinous cretin, too.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got my copy of the brochure in the post yesterday, and although this is beginning to feel like a bit of a pile-on by now I have to say: it&#039;s pathetic.

Apart from the ugly thermal motif discussed at length elsewhere, it contains no explanations of what the various performances actually &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;.  All I have before me is a list of names and times and no idea what they might be.

Making a booklet that people are going to want to carry around with them all day A4 sized is the work of an uncommonly cretinous cretin, too.]]></description>
