		<description><![CDATA[This is so crazy. Why wouldn&#039;t they at least support a local coffe shop. The world is whacked om Starbucks. For Gods sake. choose a company in your community, not a cookie cutter corporate coffee company with less than honorable ideas about community and nation. Just my opinion.]]></description>
