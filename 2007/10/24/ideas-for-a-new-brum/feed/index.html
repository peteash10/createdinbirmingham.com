		<description><![CDATA[Just read Stef&#039;s posting about the first meeting with urban initiatives - sounds exciting and I recall the impacts of the last big rethink of the city centre - some good some bad.  It would be great to link up with some of the &#039;propositions&#039; for digbeth that came out of a project that MADE ran earlier this year - four artists considering the potential for Digbeth and the challenges of resisting the gentrification of the area - Stuart Mugrdige, Rob Colbourne, Sturat Whipps and Nicole Slater Hunt - there&#039;s an exhibition on now at MADE - 122 Fazelely Street - &#039;Holding the Edge&#039;.  The opporunity for broader voices to present alternative propositions in the context of change within the city needs to be welcomed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also contributing to this - so its great that the City&#039;s creative sector has some representation as the role of culture and creativity is absolutely central to the City&#039;s master planning process. 

Stef&#039;s crowdsourcing idea is great - so do contribute your thoughts and we&#039;ll do our best to represnt them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really heartened that they&#039;re asking people like Stef to be involved with this. I don&#039;t know who else from within Brum&#039;s creative chunk they&#039;ve also invited, but I truly hope that this is an active environment for participation, input and tangible output for all involved rather than just a token one. 

Total transparency is a must if this is to be a real vision with acknowledged, workable and well-considered outcomes for a city which (to an alien in Brum like me) has a shedload to crow about and, yet, has so much to come.]]></description>
