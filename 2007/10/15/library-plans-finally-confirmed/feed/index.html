		<description><![CDATA[I support the current plans. We knew about the location a long time back and it was then that I was sceptical that they could actually fit a larger library on the site. The idea to combine the Rep and Library is a fantastic one though. We don&#039;t need some councillor blurting the typical &quot;world class&quot; every now and then to realise that this could actually have potential.

As for the current library, I think they could do with demolished the buildings either side and leaving the upturned ziggurat structure. This can then be preserved and listed. Of course, it&#039;s going to need repair work as it is literally falling down now. I think it will be best to turn the areas either side of it into new walkways to Centenary Square as it is a bit of a bottleneck.

As far as I am aware though, the council plan to have the site demolished and cleared to make way for a massive office development. I am supportive of that too as long as it respects the location. I don&#039;t think we will be seeing any plans for that for another 5 years at least, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[personally i used to like the paradise square complex as it was before it was turned into paradise forum - i found the experience of walking through it to the school of music &#039;dramatic&#039;...

i think the problem with the arguments put forward by the &#039;friends of the central library&#039; is they&#039;re missing the point that although it was perfectly designed to be a central lending library as libraries were 30 years ago, libraries need to be very different animals now, &#038; the building really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; now, to use the in vogue term, no longer fit for purpose.

it&#039;s a magnificent building which deserves listing &#038; preservation to be sure - so those who would keep it would be better off wholeheartedly supporting the new library of birmingham concept whatever &#038; wherever it ends up being, whilst at the same time campaigning for new uses for the existing building (hey - what about as part of the rationalisation of council buildings it becomes council offices ?!) rather than campaigning to keep it as a library.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I understand it there&#039;s a battle at the moment between those who would have it listed and those who would have it demolished. I believe the council is in favour of demolition but don&#039;t hold me to that. 

Personally I like it as a structure (especially when approached from Centenary Sq) but I know people who work in the bowels think it a terrible place - sick building syndrome is often cited.]]></description>
