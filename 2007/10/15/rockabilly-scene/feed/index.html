		<description><![CDATA[Hi Pete,
There&#039;s a great monthly rockabilly night with DJ and a band at Ladywood Social Club. It is run by Rockin&#039; In Brum (the myspace site is http://www.myspace.com/rockin_in_brum). And, if you&#039;re after a rockin&#039; gig, try Nate Pilgrim and the Magnificatz at the Bar Academy on 16th November. Should declare an interest here, as I play in the band...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi there, so yes I asked about events etc. I thought Coldrice had stopped doing events to be honest and also, I never really understood what type of events they used to put on, I mean what kind of music because it was always at bar academy and it seemed to be just live bands, no DJaying and my friends wouldn&#039;t really go to just a live gig...Anyway...that&#039;s not important. I&#039;m just gutted I missed Heavy Trash...I hv seen JSBX before, thankfully but still....It&#039;s the second time I miss Jon Spencer in the past ten years - yes that long- and well...one shouldn&#039;t miss Jon Spencer really....ever.My fault. Can&#039;t get over it. Will talk about it for years to come....haha.]]></description>
