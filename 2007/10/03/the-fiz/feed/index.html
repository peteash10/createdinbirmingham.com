		<description><![CDATA[I reckon that the mobile web will be via phone networks before wi-fi is ubiquitous enough to make it worthwhile for most people to carry round internet enable devices. 

I really hope the FIZ thing works, as I&#039;m sure there are a couple of times I&#039;d have used it in the past -  it is important tho&#039; that the more tech-savvy of us feedback with suggestions - we can see the maps/listings/social mash-ups in a way the more corporate don&#039;t seem to.

Imagine allowing free access to any non-profit Brum webiste, that&#039;d be something to be really proud of.]]></description>
