		<description><![CDATA[Head. Nail. The. On. Hit. 

Nice one Pete, your perception is exactly what Town Hall is striving for...an alternative to some of the other venues in Birmingham, and somewhere that Brummies (whether part of the city&#039;s arts and music scene or not) can relate to.

For the chance to win a pair of tickets to the Capsule event, running until Monday!]]></description>
