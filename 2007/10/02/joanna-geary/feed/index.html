		<description><![CDATA[i was offering a nod at mikhail&#039;s reaction to anything which starts a bit of a barney - i expected that particular topic above to provoke similar reactions, given similar topics here.

i&#039;ve put her blog into my google reader, but given she&#039;s only posted two more entries (which i haven&#039;t read yet anyway) it&#039;s too early for me to say whether or not i like it - though i did think that particular post was spot on, as it happens; &#038; quite apt, given the extremely positive meeting i had at arts central yesterday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looked at that twice birmingham and still can&#039;t get it.

I&#039;m liking Jo&#039;s blog. Are you not?

If I&#039;m not mistaken, today she found that she&#039;s going to be working out of the sixth floor of Fort Dunlop - I think it could get quite lively.

Incidentally I read the Post today and there was one whole page with a good editorial, a piece from Clare Short and a column from the Stirrer that all left me feeling that they were worth reading. 

Maybe it&#039;s an age thang.]]></description>
