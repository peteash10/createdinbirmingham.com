		<description><![CDATA[Indeed the registration is intended to stem the flow of spam...I do recognise that this may be short sighted, so will be removing this requirement. 

I am heartened to find out that I am wrong and there is stuff going on in Brum which I will checking out and commenting on through the klunk medium. 

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You probably have to factor in a fear of spam into it. Registration only comments are very tempting but, in my analysis, not worth it in the long term.

Remember registration is defacto in the world of forums - it&#039;s just blogs have a tradition of open comments. If you&#039;re coming from a forum mindset it makes perfect sense. Wrong sense, but sense all the same.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would you say, young Pete, that (on a quasi-pop-philosophical level) there&#039;s an obvious parallel to be drawn between the sort of insularity needed to require someone to register to comment, and the sort of insularity needed to keep your eyes shut to all of the interesting things a-happening?]]></description>
