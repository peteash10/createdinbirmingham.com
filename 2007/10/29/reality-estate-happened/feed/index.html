		<description><![CDATA[Like everyone else who has posted here or I have spoken to, I thought this was a brilliant achievement and really enjoyable.  I thought it was quite poignant in that we were led around the estate and places that frankly I would not visit out of choice and stories unfolded and in some cases just general magical weirdness.  I talked to some of the local participants who could not speak highly enough of how much they had got from the project.  fantastic indeed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw Reality Estate as well and yes it was brilliant, fantastic,amazing and yes these words are not enough. I enjoyed it despite some technical hitches but it didn&#039;t matter. And just to say that this is not just the beginning of a year of work,they have been working there for the past two years already and they will still be there and that is what matters. Good one, Friction ;-)]]></description>
