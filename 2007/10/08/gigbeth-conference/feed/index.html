		<description><![CDATA[Look, we can all criticise, thats by the by.
I think the main point here is that there was no one at the event.
For a supposed profit making event this would appear to be losing a whole lot of money and face to the midlands, so do we need it, i have yet to be convinced

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree. I saw some great stuff and I think that the music choices were good overall. yes the opening ceremony was a problem and I would like to know how the tech people thought that kit was up to the job.

I didnt go to the conference but have heard good things about it and I saw some great stuff at the Sanctuary at at the Adam and Eve.

If they sort the tech out I reckon Gigbeth is a good thing that I would go to again]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
I was present for a few of the Gigbeth days and i am afraid to say my opinions are very simular to Andy B&#039;s at the top of the page...

Did noone else think it was a wash out?? And as for the opening ceremony... the small crowd was kept waiting for ages with technical faults, the acts were rushed - Nizlopi playing only 3 songs?? and it generally being a shambles on stage with the right hand speakers turning off and on!

Do all 34 sponsors experience the festival for them selves? and if they did would the invest next time?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I assumed the 30,000 crowd was some kind of BRMB / Heart FM Party In The Park style jamboree, given that it&#039;s supposed to be free. 

Ah! I&#039;ve found it! He&#039;s talking about the Xmas Light Switchon at Millennium Point!
http://www.brmb.co.uk/Article.asp?id=495887&amp;spid=365

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Saturday November 10th, bestselling girl group, the Sugababes will &#039;push the button&#039; on the Retail Birmingham Christmas Lights Switch On 2007 at Millenium Point.

Thanks to us here at BRMB they will also be performing, along with McFly, Leona Lewis, Scouting For Girls, Booty Luv and Aaron Yorke at Birmingham&#039;s largest free pop concert this year!

PLUS Elliott and Caroline will be your hosts for the evening.

It&#039;s set to be a fantastic day for the whole family, with music and entertainment, fireworks and much more.

What: Retail Birmingham Christmas Lights Switch On 2007
When: Saturday November 10th
Where: Millenium Point
Time: 3pm - 7.30pm
Cost: FREE!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How could &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; compete with that! We might as well all just give up and go home, I reckon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Touring Car factories aren&#039;t sexy now, Pete?  I thought motor racing was very fashionable of late.  Arf.

Re-stating what we already understood from your first post still doesn&#039;t change the fact that the metaphor he used to express it was a half-baked one, anyway.

It&#039;s only just occurred to me that he mentioned a &quot;30,000 strong crowd&quot;.  That seems even sillier than the silly fiscal numbers quoted.  Which venue is this, now?  I&#039;d missed that bit.

Oh, I do hope he comes back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that for the price, Gigbeth is a fantastic opportunity to experience some new talent and do so within the atmosphere of collaborative appreciation and ears who like something asides from the norm. The sums are definitely wrong on Mr. B&#039;s part. And as for this:

&quot;What young person would want to pay Â£60 to see a bunch of â€˜Câ€™ list bands and students from South Birmingham College in half- empty venues, when, if they hung-on a week, they could see the likes of The Sugarbabes, Scouting for Girls, McFly and much more for free in the city centre - with a 30,000 strong crowd ?&quot;

Hello. your chosen &#039;acts&#039; are hardly inspiring me here..... me smells a promoter....]]></description>
