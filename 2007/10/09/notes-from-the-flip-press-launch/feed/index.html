		<description><![CDATA[Good to see you there today Pete. Here&#039;s a correction from me about the stats. As soon as I said the words &#039;30% more&#039; today I knew I&#039;d gotten a couple of things mixed up in my head. The word &#039;more&#039; is the misleading one and I got the figure wrong too. Doh!

Here&#039;s what I should have said:
&quot;Between 2001 and 2005 there was a 31% increase in TV &#038; Radio businesses in the West Midlands.&quot; 

Leaving it there is impressive but we should correctly place that in the context of the UK:

&quot;In the same period in England as a whole there was a 27% increase.&quot; 

So the difference is in fact a mere 4%.

However, the number of business units doing motion picture and video production grew by 33% in England as a whole, but grew at a much higher rate in the West Midlands (46%).

So in that category we grew 13% more which is genuinely impressive. Animation actually spills into both categories as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14012&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SIC code system&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#039;t allow it a code for itself.

Hope that&#039;s a bit clearer. I was tempted to let the bad stat stand but as soon as I saw it here I felt guilty and had to correct it.
