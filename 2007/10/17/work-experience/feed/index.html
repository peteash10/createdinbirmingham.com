		<description><![CDATA[But it&#039;s work /experience/ - good or bad, and witnessing people within the commercial strictures of larger organisation is probably more useful than dallying through copies of Creative Review in a design agency. And that&#039;s just my experience too ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But these large companies usually have horrible graphics departments. Just my experience but some small companies do take a fair amount of work experience places. I don&#039;t know anyone currently accepting placements though, sorry!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been on the receiving end of these requests many times, in my previous life as a partner in a small firm. When we couldn&#039;t fit the kid in, I&#039;d always suggest telephoning large non-connected businesses (like Severn Trent, National Grid et al) - they tend to have a PR or graphics department, and are far more likely to have an established pattern for helping work experience folk.]]></description>
