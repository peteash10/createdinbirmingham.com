		<description><![CDATA[Who is this David Oz!? He&#039;s clearly a master when it comes to sculpting a site out of Drupal.

I like the big drop shaddowed text â€“ very nice. Not sure about the colours and the feathering, but it looks like a nice working site. 

Students/faculties should organise more of these independent sites to show off work and research. They provide a much greater insight for propestive students than the offical biad/bcu sites.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Drupal   slightly unofficial. Marvellous! Credibility rating going up...

Wondering vaguely about comments elsewhere that Drupal is &lt;a href=&quot;http://peteashton.com/2007/10/wordpress_vs_drupal/#comment-13320&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; superb for co-blogging and community stuff&lt;/a&gt; who would we like to see providing the content for the site? ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That reminds me of something funny that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt; said &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallingoffablog.typepad.com/falling_off_a_blog/2007/09/the-dawning-of-.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;at the dConstruct conference this year&lt;/a&gt;: 

&quot;For those of you who haven&#039;t heard of Sharepoint, Sharepoint is an amazing way to destroy a business. Building an intranet using Sharepoint is like having a friend take you to a lumber yard and tell you &#039;everything you need to build your house is here - get going&#039;&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not convinced this is a new site. BIAD&#039;s original site is still available:
http://www.biad.uce.ac.uk/home.htm
As is the centralised version.

This site, I beleive, is specifically from the Fine Art dept. 

These are interesting comments and I don&#039;t expect I am the only person from BCU reading.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Though I don&#039;t think the look of it is up to much (the .titles remind me of the Birmingham Artists website, and the colours are unpleasant), content-wise it&#039;s interesting. 

I think it&#039;ll give current and prospective students a much better idea of what&#039;s going on, who&#039;s who and, I suppose, more of a sense of belonging to a community. It certainly helps the faculty come across as being progressive, which I guess is pretty important for an art school.]]></description>
