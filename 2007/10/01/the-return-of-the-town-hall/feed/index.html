		<description><![CDATA[Just listened to the first, very much focussed on the build up to the re-opening rather than the history of the building. More interesting for me as I&#039;ve heard a lot about the history from other sources recently. Sounds like the second two parts (same time for the next couple of weeks) will be continuing that. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/returnofthetownhall for the next 7 days) 

For real Town Hall affictionardos, or those who prefer the telly, Inside Out (BBC 2 7.30 tonight) has one of its sections about the Town Hall.

&lt;i&gt;And I didn&#039;t know Reeta Chakrabarti was a Brummie&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>
