				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Guest post by <a href="http://inkygoodness.com/blog/news/glug-poster-competition-winner-announcement/">Lara Shingles / Inkygoodness</a>:</em></p>

<p><strong>After weeks of sifting through a dizzying collection of submissons, we’re delighted to announce the winners of <a href="http://www.inkygoodness.com">Inkygoodness</a> &amp; <a href="http://createdinbirmingham.com/">Created in Birmingham&#8217;s</a> Glug Birmingham Poster Competition – <a href="http://www.louisebyng.co.uk/">Louise Byng</a> and <a href="http://laurieramsell.co.uk/">Laurie Ramsell</a>.</strong></p>
<p>A fun, playful and inventive competition entry, the creative pair ticked all our boxes with their playful DIY aesthetic.<span id="more-15550"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>We received some fantastic entries, but Louise and Laurie’s design was unlike anything else! Their clever interpretation of the theme makes great use of the limited colour palette, whilst combining hand made and digital image-making to produce a fun and playful design that really stands out.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Lisa Hassell, Director of Inkygoodness</p>
<p>Louise and Laurie took inspiration from Birmingham’s cultural and economic landscape for their winning design: “How [Birmingham] looks now; what it is becoming known for; and how that may have shifted since the original crest was conceived. With start-up companies and innovative independents now a huge driver for the city’s contemporary status, says Louise.</p>
<blockquote><p>We approached the design as a collaborative project, recreating the City of Birmingham’s crest physically and applying its dual representation of arts and industry to the creative sector. Our reworked motif depicts creativity as a personal expression and philosophy, but also a trade and a craft – something that resonates with Birmingham’s values and rich history as a city.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-11-18-Glug-Brum-Competition-winners1-e1416353193774.jpg" alt="2014-11-18-Glug-Brum-Competition-winners1-e1416353193774" width="560" height="792" /></p>
<p>The assemblage itself is low-fi and involved bringing together cardboard, staples and paint into a photographic set-up, keeping much of the construction visible in order to share this with the audience, encouraging a playful DIY approach to design rather than hiding the process away.” continues Louise.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a lot of fun to make, and as artists in the early stages of our careers it’s great to be recognised by glug in our home city; to share our impression of Birmingham with a wider audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>The creative pair are now in the throes of preparing a short presentation to join our Glug speakers on stage to share the process behind creating their winning artwork. 2nd prize goes to illustrator William Wright who designed this snazzy pencil design. William receives a goodie bag of art prints and illustrated zines, plus a pair of tickets to attend Glug Brum on Thursday evening!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/wp-content/uploads/Will-Wright--610x877.jpg" alt="Will-Wright-" width="610" height="877" /></p>
<p>Our shortlist includes 23 artworks hand picked from our entries earlier this week. Selected exhibiting artists are (in no particular order): Ian Aparici, Scott Williams, Sophie Kozlowski, Adam Moore, Ngu Ngok Chin, James Baldry, Jenny Sjodin, Bethany Raistrick, Georgia Fenton, Chantal Caduff, Rhiannon Sanderson, Súa Agapé, Fiona Hall, Mouni Feddag, Katie Tomlinson, Lesley Imgart, Jimmy Rogers, Amy Kilner, Liam Anslow, Daniel O’Brien, Raj Dhunna, Nick Tyler, Adam Corns &amp; Graham Johnson.</p>
<p>Attendees will get the opportunity to pick up their favourite Glug Poster design as a limited edition print courtesy of our exhibition sponsors Ripe Digital – priced at £15 each.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank everyone for taking part in our first Glug Birmingham competition – we received over 100 entries and selecting our shortlist was a (fun) challenge. We hope you can join us on Thursday evening.</p>

<h3>Our Speakers</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://florenceblanchard.com/">Florence Blanchard</a> / EMA + Bradbury &amp; Blanchard Gallery</strong></p>
<p>Sheffield-based artist Florence Blanchard adopted the moniker ‘EMA’ in the early 90’s when she began spray-painting the walls of her hometown Montpellier (Fr), inspired by the worldwide graffiti phenomenon and its instantaneous appeal.</p>
<p>Utilising acrylic, watercolour, silkscreen and spray-paint on canvas – EMA creates a world of abstract scenes populated by illustrative figures in a dream-like state. Now based in Sheffield where she co-owns Bradbury &amp; Blanchard printing studio and gallery, she continues to explore themes of symbolism, and science fiction.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Javens &amp; Simon Peplow / <a href="http://outcrowdcollective.blogspot.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">The Outcrowd Collective</a></strong></p>
<p>‘The Outcrowd’ is is a shambolic visual collection of hoodlums and battered psyches, born out of a basic obsession to create.</p>
<p>Not to be trusted with pen, paper or any other medium that can leave a mark. Initially formed amongst a group of friends, skateboarders, illustrators, designers, image-makers and lurkers. Birmingham-based Ben Javens and Simon Peplow take the stage to share their stories.</p>

<p><strong>Joel Millerchip, Kris Jones &amp; Mr the Beef / <a href="http://www.brothersofthestripe.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Brothers of the Stripe</a></strong></p>
<p>Brothers of the Stripe (BOTS) are a collection of illustrators, graphic designers and image makers from all corners of the UK.</p>
<p>With many major cities represented, we are able to support each other in presenting our collective works to the various regions. The BOTS are an all-male team of movers and shakers, united by their devotion to their style and craft, support for each others and their willingness to play outside their comfort zones.</p>

<p>Glug is a series of events for the design and creative community. Our showcase event is held in London but there are now 8 other events around the world. Based around a series of talks and informal networking, Glug has become one of the most exciting, credible and well attended creative events around.</p>
<p>Established in 2007, it’s an eclectic mix of people from all creative walks of life; from advertising and graphic design through to fashion and architecture. Glug started as a handful of mates talking shop in an East London pub. Two years later and it’s an international and national event with over 8000 signed-up members on MeetUp.</p>
<p>Over this time we’ve had great talks, film preview, live art, installations and exhibitions from the likes of Airside, Anthony Burrill, I Love Dust, Jason Bruges Studio, usTwo™, Mainframe, Marc Kremers, Noma Bar, Wolff Olins and Why Not Associates.</p>
<p>Currently Glug events are popping up in: London, New York City, Birmingham, Beijing, Brighton, Edinburgh, Auckland &amp; Nottingham.</p>
<p>So there it is, get yourselves down! New Gluggers are always welcome to come along and see what it’s all about, so bring a friend and get Notworking™</p>

<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to announce we are going to have our first CiB Charity of the Year.</p>
<p>*round of applause*</p>
<p>As you know, Created in Birmingham is a blog linking up creative and artistic communities: we find out what&#8217;s going on in the area and promote it voluntarily. Whilst that&#8217;s in itself is a good thing, we feel that we&#8217;re in the position to be able to go one step further in helping those communities. We&#8217;re joining forces with <a href="http://creativesatwork.wordpress.com/">The CAW Foundation</a> (CAW stands for Creatives at Work) to fundraise for Artistic, Cultural, Sporting and Social Change projects in Birmingham, and the funds will be administered by the <a href="http://www.bbccf.org.uk/">Birmingham &amp; Black Country Community Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>More specifically, we&#8217;ll be raising money to support projects that work with young people and disadvantaged groups, empowering them to change their outlook and opportunities in life. Together CAW and CiB will have complete control over how the money we raise will be spent – we will help The CAW Foundation team decide which worthy good causes and charities that are already doing amazing work in our local communities will benefit from CAW Grants. We have an effective way of having a say of where the money goes, directing funds raised into the heart of our local communities, encouraging activities that benefit us all.</p>
<p>The CAW Foundation is all about ‘Creatives at work for the next generation’ so &#8211; it really is the perfect partnership for our creative community of CiB to make a change and have a real impact on helping to inspire and shape the future professionals of our sector.</p>
<p>Rob Langley-Swain founded The CAW Foundation in August 2012 and had this to say about our new partnership:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m thrilled that CiB have chosen CAW as their Charity of the Year for the next 12 months. I set up The CAW Foundation because I felt there was a real gap and a need for people to support small, grass roots good causes and charities that have suffered from funding and grant cuts from the likes of The Arts Council and Local Authorities. I witnessed a number of amazing charities shut down or diminish their creative output because of lost funding and decided I couldn’t just stand by and let it happen.</p>
<p>The CAW Foundation’s ambition is to raise at least £50,000 by 2015 – 60% of everything we raise will go in to a long term legacy trust fund, which will then earn interest and pay out to good causes long in to the future. 40% of funds raised each year will be spent immediately in small grants to good causes that meet our funding criteria and can demonstrate what impact they’ll have on Young People and deprived communities – through Artistic, Cultural, Sporting or Social Change projects.</p>
<p>In the past 11 months we have managed to raise a very respectable £13,000 and we are set to make our first round of Grants to good causes in September. Having the support of CiB’s community is going to be a real boost and enable us to reach even more young people through numerous projects with our grant making – and ultimately that is what it is all about. We can’t wait to get cracking on some creative fundraising!</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is just an introduction to CiB&#8217;s Charity of the Year intentions: you&#8217;ll notice we&#8217;ve added a widget on the right handside of the page that links to our <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/CiB">justgiving page</a> &#8211; <em>which is a little inactive at the moment whilst we&#8217;re event planning</em> &#8211;  throughout the year we will be holding fundraising events and other fun things. The basic idea being we&#8217;ll start doing CiB stuff in real life (not just online), and raise money for good causes at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;ve just hit 10,000 followers on twitter, so we decided on the figure of £10,000 to begin with.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>If you have any questions, have ideas, or would like to get involved, then speak to me about it by emailing createdinbirmingham@gmail.com with FAO Kerry in the subject line.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to write something on CiB?</p>
<p>We get plenty of emails from people wanting to contribute to the blog but the answer&#8217;s always the same &#8211; put that stuff on your own blog and perhaps we&#8217;ll link to it. Mainly that&#8217;s because CiB&#8217;s always been about encouraging others to have their own outlets for expression.</p>
<p>We probably won&#8217;t be able to post <em>everything</em> but maybe this&#8217;ll turn into a regular thing. Or maybe we&#8217;ll give March over entirely to guest posts and never do it again. Who knows? Maybe we won&#8217;t get much of a response and we&#8217;ll forget this post ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>Topics for discussion</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s up to you, just don&#8217;t get us into too much trouble.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s an area we don&#8217;t do a very good job of covering, or something you want to have a rant about (opinions are good) or maybe there&#8217;s something that you know that you want to share.</p>
<p>You may know of an undiscovered portion of Birmingham that deserves a mention, or want to feature some amazing local talent you&#8217;ve come across. Maybe there&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s not being addressed. Whatever you have to say, we&#8217;re open to ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>Text, video, photo &#8211; whatever suits you best.</p>
<p><strong>A note about self-promotion</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>This isn&#8217;t an opportunity for some free press, advertising space or link spam. If you want to promote yourself/your clients then by all means <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/about/advertise/">advertise with us</a> or <a href="http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/contact/">get in touch with us</a> in the usual way.</p>
<p><strong>How to get involved</strong></p>
<p>Simply <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDRWekpETWU5OFNXamFmdFlLTTN4MkE6MQ&amp;theme=0AX42CRMsmRFbUy00ODg0N2E0OC04ZjI0LTQyZDItOTQ4Ni1hMDNhZTRkNGI5NmY&amp;ifq">click this link and fill out this form</a>. At this stage we just want to know who you are and roughly what you&#8217;d like to talk about.</p>
