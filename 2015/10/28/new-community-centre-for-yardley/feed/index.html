		<description><![CDATA[Dear all, 

My grand dad has passed away and we will be cremating him in yardley cremation centre. 
We are like looking to arrange a small gathering of 30-40 people and have some food. We are looking for a community hall and have come across yours which is really nice. 

Please could you let us know if it would be possible to hire? What is the price for hiring for upto 5 hours? Parking space? Tables and chairs? 

Our number is 07455000585, in case if you would like to discuss, alternatively please drop me an email regarding our query.
